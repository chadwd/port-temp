## Beyond Best Practices

Best practices are useful shortcuts, but they can also be intellectual crutches. When we default to "how it's usually done," we inherit assumptions that may not apply to our specific context.

First principles thinking offers an alternative: strip away assumptions until you reach fundamental truths, then reason up from there.

## The Decomposition Process

Elon Musk famously applied this to battery costs. Instead of accepting market prices, he asked: what are batteries made of? What do those materials cost? The answer revealed massive inefficiency in the supply chain.

In product design, the same approach applies:

- **What problem are we actually solving?** (Not what feature are we building)
- **What are the fundamental user needs?** (Not what competitors offer)
- **What are the true constraints?** (Not the assumed limitations)

## Practical Application

First principles thinking in product design might look like:

1. **Question the brief** - Before designing a "dashboard," ask what decisions users need to make. Maybe they don't need a dashboard at all.

2. **Ignore existing solutions** - Temporarily forget how other products solve this. What would you build if starting from scratch?

3. **Identify real constraints** - Technical limitations, business requirements, user capabilities. Separate these from conventions masquerading as constraints.

4. **Build up logically** - From fundamental needs and real constraints, what solution emerges?

## The Cost of First Principles

This approach is expensive. It takes time and mental energy. It can feel like reinventing wheels. Not every problem merits this investment.

Use first principles for:
- Novel problem spaces
- High-stakes decisions
- Situations where conventional wisdom isn't working
- Breakthrough innovation needs

Use best practices for:
- Solved problems
- Low-stakes decisions
- Speed-critical situations
- Commoditized features

## Finding Balance

The goal isn't to first-principles everything. It's to know when to apply deep reasoning versus pattern matching. Build the skill so it's available when you need it.

The question to ask: "Am I reasoning from fundamentals, or from analogy?" Both have their place. Know which one you're using.
