## 60-Second Summary (TL;DR)

- **The outcome:** What materially changed for the business, team, or system
- **Why it mattered:** The problem this unblocked or de-risked
- **What I did:** 1–2 lines on the operating model or decisions, not deliverables
- **Proof:** Concrete signals (metrics, adoption, shipped artifacts, cycle-time change)

---

## Overview (Impact-First)

- **Primary Impact:** The single most important result (business or organizational)
- **Secondary Impacts:** 2–3 supporting outcomes
- **Role:**
- **Timeframe:**
- **Scope:** Team size, surfaces, systems touched
- **Why This Is Hard:** One line on what made this non-trivial

---

## Why Leadership Needed Proof

- Executive or leadership mandate
- What decision, investment, or risk depended on this work
- Why the existing approach was insufficient

---

## The Real Problem (Not the Obvious One)

- The surface problem everyone talked about
- The underlying system or workflow failure
- What would have broken if nothing changed

---

## Operating Model We Proved

- One-sentence strategy statement
- The mental model guiding decisions
- What this replaced or disrupted

---

## The 3 Decisions That Drove the Outcome

### Decision 1: [Decision Name]

- **Problem it solved:**
- **Options considered:**
- **Tradeoff accepted:**
- **Decision:**
- **Why this worked:**
- **Proof:** Evidence or validation signal

### Decision 2: [Decision Name]

(repeat as needed, max 3)

---

## Evidence and Validation

- Quantitative signals (metrics, deltas, counts, time saved)
- Qualitative signals (adoption, behavior change, confidence)
- What would not have happened without this work

---

## Constraints That Shaped the Work

- Security, compliance, or platform constraints
- Organizational or timing constraints
- Human constraints (skill gaps, confidence, trust)

---

## What This Enabled Next

- Immediate follow-on impact
- How this scales beyond the initial project
- Who else can now participate because of this system

---

## Reflection (Forward-Looking)

- What capability this unlocked for me
- How this changed how I approach problems
- What kinds of problems I now look for

---

## Appendix (Optional)

- Supporting artifacts
- Deep technical details
- Additional metrics or timelines
- Additional Link to work / URL
