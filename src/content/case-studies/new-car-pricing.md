## Overview

Buying a new car is one of the most significant purchases most people make, yet the pricing experience remains opaque and anxiety-inducing. This project tackled the challenge of bringing transparency and confidence to car pricing.

## Problem

Traditional car pricing suffers from information asymmetry. Buyers don't know the true cost, dealers play games with numbers, and the entire experience erodes trust. Users reported feeling:

- Overwhelmed by pricing complexity (MSRP, invoice, holdback, incentives)
- Distrustful of dealer quotes
- Anxious about negotiation
- Uncertain if they got a fair deal

## Approach

The design approach centered on radical transparency:

1. **Deconstruct pricing** - Break down every component so users understand what they're paying for
2. **Market context** - Show what others are paying for the same vehicle in their area
3. **Confidence indicators** - Clear signals about deal quality
4. **Remove friction** - Streamlined path from research to purchase

### Key Design Decisions

- Progressive disclosure of pricing details (summary first, deep dive available)
- Visual comparison tools for trim levels and options
- Real-time market data integration
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Outcome

The redesigned pricing experience resulted in:

- 35% increase in user confidence scores
- 28% reduction in time-to-decision
- Significant improvement in NPS from car buyers
- Decreased reliance on third-party pricing tools
