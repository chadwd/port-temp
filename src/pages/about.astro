        I design product ecosystems, workflows, and design systems that help organizations make sound decisions under real constraints. My work sits at the intersection of customer experience, business economics, and emerging technology. I am most effective in high-stakes environments where problems are not fully defined and teams need structure they can trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do not optimize for screens in isolation. I optimize for clarity, durability, and organizational momentum. My responsibility is not only what ships next, but what continues to scale after I step away.

      <section class="bio">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          My career has been shaped by operating inside complex, high-pressure environments where direction shifts, ownership changes, and information is incomplete.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have led and stabilized enterprise initiatives across pricing, inventory, alerts, and AI-assisted workflows. I am often brought into spaces where execution risk is high and alignment is fragile. In those moments, I focus on creating shared understanding, predictable structure, and decision-making systems that allow teams to move forward with confidence.
        </p>
        <p>I am consistently trusted to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bring structure to undefined problem spaces</li>
          <li>Build systems that outlast individual projects</li>
          <li>Translate strategy into executable design architecture</li>
          <li>Increase the effectiveness of the people around me</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I have owned multi-phase initiatives end to end, supported executive priorities, mentored senior designers, partnered deeply with engineering leadership, and guided teams through organizational change without losing delivery momentum. My focus remains constant: reduce friction, increase trust, and help teams operate at a higher level.
        </p>

      <section class="philosophy">
        <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
        <p>My design philosophy is grounded in three principles that guide how I operate at scale.</p>

        <h3>Integrity</h3>
        <p>
          Integrity shows up in how I design systems and how I work with people. I believe clarity is a form of respect. I am direct and consistent so teammates can trust both the work and the reasoning behind it. I invest time in mentoring designers and partners so they can build confidence, judgment, and leadership of their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, this has meant working closely with teammates like Jake and Emily to raise the bar on research, design systems, and execution. I share context early, explain decision logic, and invite challenge. When people understand the system, they stop needing permission and start leading.
        </p>

        <h3>Courage</h3>
        <p>
          Courage is both personal and collective. I step forward when direction is unclear, decisions feel rushed, or important questions are being avoided. I ask the hard questions first so others feel safe asking theirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I model curiosity over certainty and encourage asking why before deciding how. Better design comes from better questions, and better questions come from environments where people feel supported, not judged. Courage is not volume. It is steadiness that allows honest thinking to surface.
        </p>

        <h3>Unity</h3>
        <p>
          Unity is how strong individuals become high-performing systems. I intentionally blur the lines between product owners, designers, and engineers because the best outcomes happen when thinking is shared, not handed off.
        </p>
        <p>
          I bring roles closer together through shared language, shared artifacts, and shared ownership of outcomes. I experiment with collaborative practices like peer-designing, inspired by peer-coding, to improve ideation quality, team morale, and trust. Unity is not consensus. It is alignment that accelerates execution and compounds impact.

      <section class="approach">
        <h2>How I Operate Day to Day</h2>
        <p>I operate with intention, consistency, and respect for people's time and attention.</p>
        <p>Day to day, this means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Aligning on the problem before debating solutions</li>
          <li>Making decision criteria explicit so trade-offs are visible</li>
          <li>Working alongside product and engineering rather than through handoffs</li>
          <li>Using shared artifacts to keep thinking transparent and reusable</li>
          <li>Measuring progress by outcomes, not activity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I ask why early to prevent costly rework later. I surface risks while they are small. I document decisions so teams can move independently without losing context.
        </p>
        <p>
          I balance urgency with thoughtfulness. When speed matters, I help teams move decisively. When stakes are high, I slow the work just enough to improve decision quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is simple: help teams think clearly, move together, and ship work worth standing behind.
