## About the Job

### Build to Protect Civilization

TRM is a blockchain intelligence company on a mission to build a safer world for billions of people. We’re a lean, high-impact team tackling some of the world’s most critical challenges, ranging from human trafficking and financial fraud to terrorist financing. We are builders who power governments, financial institutions, and crypto companies when the clock is running and the consequences are real. This is why every TRMer is a bet on our future and has the power to change our trajectory.

As a Senior Product Designer, you'll shape the design culture, systems, and strategy for a company building world-class products. You'll need to be a self-starter who thrives on execution, owns the design process end-to-end, and collaborates cross-functionally with teams across Product, Engineering, Marketing, and Sales. This is a pivotal role for someone passionate about creating scalable design engines and delivering exceptional user experiences.

## The Impact You Will Have

- Lead the end-to-end design process, from discovery and wireframing to prototyping and delivery, ensuring a high standard of quality across all touchpoints.
- Create and maintain design systems, workflows, and tools that enable rapid execution and consistency as we scale.
- Partner with Sales, Marketing, Product, and Engineering to align on shared goals and deliver user-centric solutions that also drive business impact.
- Champion user-centered design across the organization, influencing product strategy and fostering a high-performance design ethos.
- Rapidly onboard to TRM’s product and business to begin delivering value within the first 90 days.

## Life at TRM

We build to protect civilization. That promise shows up in how we work every day.

TRM runs fast. Really fast. We’re a high-velocity team that expects ownership, clarity, and follow-through. People who thrive here are inspired by hard problems, experimentation, and direct feedback. If it takes months elsewhere, it often ships here in days. If you are optimizing primarily for consistent work-life balance, use the interview process to pressure-test fit. We want teammates who thrive here, not just survive here.

We coach directly, assume positive intent, and play for the front of the jersey.
