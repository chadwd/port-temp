# Senior Staff Product Designer \- Platform

Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?

At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.

To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.

Our [work culture](https://www.coinbase.com/mission) is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.

While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.

The Role

The Platform Design and Research team at Coinbase plays a critical role in executing our vision to create more economic freedom for the world. This team is at the center of execution for products across the entirety of the company. We’re building the most secure, trusted, and easiest-to-use cryptocurrency products for millions of people just getting started with crypto, as well as long-standing loyal customers with advanced knowledge of the cryptocurrency space.

As a Sr. Staff Product Designer, you will contribute to our mission, vision, and strategy through a deep understanding of customer and business needs. You will develop optimal user journeys to help our customers understand how to use cryptocurrency and complete their tasks with ease and confidence. You’ll work closely with Product, Engineering, and cross-functional (XFN) teams to build simple, easy-to-use experiences that express the Coinbase brand and values.
