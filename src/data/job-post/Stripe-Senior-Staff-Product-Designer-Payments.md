# Senior Staff Product Designer, Payments

## Who we are

### About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### About the team

The Product Design team is made up of several groups that define, create, and deliver all user-facing aspects of Stripe's brand and product. Product Designers are strategic partners to Engineering and Product Management within their product area. In close collaboration with product teams, they shape user experiences, then translate them into high-quality designs that can be tested, shipped, and refined. Designers are responsible for building elegant, functional products that users love—and want to tell others about.

Payments manages Stripe's core financial products, develops tools for efficient payment acceptance and risk management, and creates solutions that empower businesses to optimize their revenue operations. The sheer volume of payments that flow through Stripe on an hourly basis necessitates the highest level of craft and reliability, which means that Payments product designers have the chance to create and ship the best work of their careers.

## What you'll do

You will lead design for the Payments Dashboard team, seeing over the end to end payments experience for business operators and decision makers. You'll work across Payments teams, lead through your work, and collaborate closely with other designers to set a high bar for craft and quality in Payments Dashboard experiences. Initially you'll go deep on creating a new primitive in the Stripe Dashboard that enables merchants to do advanced configuration of payments acceptance and processing with little to no coding. You will also be a leader in defining AI-driven workflows and designing the merchant experience for important revenue drivers for Stripe.

### Responsibilities

## Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

### Minimum requirements

- Has 15+ years of relevant experience at a tech, product-driven company
- Skilled at operating independently to turn ambiguous, horizontal problems into simple, intuitive solutions
- Adept at translating business objectives into customer-centered design opportunities
- Impeccable visual and interaction design skills
- Confident presenting work to company leadership and skilled at communicating design decisions through clear, compelling storytelling
- Experienced in leading peer designers, either as a design manager or senior IC

### Preferred qualifications

- Experienced in working on horizontal projects that span multiple organizations and product teams
- Background in SaaS, e-commerce, or fintech products

## Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

### In-office expectations

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

### Working remotely at Stripe

A remote location is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently live or plan to live.

## Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $224,300 - $336,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role's On Target Earnings ("OTE") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate's experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.
