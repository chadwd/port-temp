# **Staff Product Designer \- Stripe**

## Who we are

### About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### About the team

The Product Design team is made up of several groups that define, create, and deliver all user-facing aspects of Stripe’s products. Product Designers work directly with Engineers, Product Managers, Data Scientists, and Marketers, as strategic partners, in each product area.  In close collaboration with product teams, they shape user experiences, then translate them into high-quality designs that can be tested, shipped, and refined. Designers are responsible for building elegant, functional products that users love—and want to tell others about.  
We are looking to hire a wide variety of Product Designers to partner with teams across: Payments, Revenue & Finance, Seller Experiences, Connect, Dashboard experiences, Billing, Terminal, and more\!   
Team Matching: exact team matching for one of the sub-teams will begin during final stages. Please note we may also consider you for different orgs based on your experience, location, interests, etc. 

## What you’ll do

You will work closely with a specific part of the business, leading the end to end work, collaborating closely with other designers to set a high bar for craft and quality experience.  Each of our roles are a mix of product strategy, new and existing feature development, and an opportunity to understand the needs of various user segments to design and build solutions that will help more people get started and run their businesses successfully on Stripe.

## Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

* 8+ years of relevant product design experience at a product-driven tech company  
* A portfolio that demonstrates strong design fundamentals and polished UI craft  
* Experience partnering closely with cross-functional teams to shape product direction  
* Ability to balance user needs, business goals, and multiple stakeholder inputs

# Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

# **In-office expectations**

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

# **Working remotely at Stripe**

A remote location is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently live or plan to live.
