# Staff Product Designer, Developer AI

## Who we are

### About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### About the team

The Product Design team is composed of several teams that work together to help define, create, and deliver all user-facing aspects of the Stripe brand and product.

Developer AI is an ambitious, boundary-pushing team reimagining Stripe’s developer experience for the AI era. We are using the latest LLMs and AI engineering techniques to help developers streamline and automate the building and maintaining of their Stripe integrations—as well as exploring entirely new ways to build alongside them.

#### Some areas we’re currently working on

- Re-imagining the zero to one integration experience for developers building on Stripe’s APIs
- Bringing Stripe knowledge (docs, reference, support, etc.) to developer fingertips, wherever they are working through tools like our powerful MCP server
- Working with our partners, like v0, to build entirely new ways to help users get set up and taking payments—in minutes, rather than weeks
- Reducing the pain of API migrations and upgrades using AI tools to make it a little bit more magic
- Exploring new, boundary-pushing ways AI can improve the overall developer experience

## What you’ll do

We’re looking for an experienced designer to help us design the future of AI for developers, and who wants to help us set the new industry standard in AI tooling.

In the Developer AI team, you will shape Stripe's developer experience and evolve it through the lens of AI and our company-wide AI strategy. You’ll have the opportunity to impact how AI tools interact with payments at scale, as well as push the boundaries of every part of the developer journey.

We’re looking for a designer that is doggedly curious, technical but creative, and deeply familiar with the AI landscape and obsessed with the ever-changing intersection of code, design, and systems thinking. If you’re the type of person that would vibe-code your design presentation for an interview with Claude Code, we should talk.

### Responsibilities

- Design and prototype innovative new developer tools and experiences from the ground up, powered by AI
- Understand the AI industry and how it’s evolving, then apply that to craft AI experiences for developers from the ground up
- Create boundary-pushing AI experiences, thinking beyond current patterns to imagine the future
- Experiment with new interaction models and patterns for using AI tools that set the standard for the industry
- Turn ambiguous problems that developer-shaped users are facing into concrete products, from proposal, to kick-off, vision, building, and launch
- Feel comfortable building with AI yourself, and understand how to prototype your ideas using these tools as a part of your design process. We strongly believe that the person in this role should lead through prototyping with AI tools and create a cultural shift in how we do design work
- Directly shape the developer experience roadmap alongside our engineers by pitching new ideas we haven’t even thought of yet
- Work closely with our partner teams, including Developer Products, Connect, Merchant Experience, and across the entire organization to uplevel our developer experiences for all types of users
- Advocate for how AI can help our users across internal teams, ensuring they understand how it will shape the entire way we ship products
- Participate in design reviews and share your work regularly with design and company leadership

## Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

We’re very interested in designers that have a coding background, such as prior experience in design engineering roles, as we believe prototyping is crucial to this role. But we’re also interested in designers that have developed a strong prototyping practice without that, too.

### Minimum requirements

- 8+ years relevant design experience at a tech, product-driven company
- Experience working on developer tools, working with developers—or even writing code yourself
- Experience using, building, or designing for AI tools and strong opinions about what makes a great AI experience—strong side-projects count
- An understanding of developers, their needs, and excitement about transforming the way developers integrate with our platform
- Experience supporting large projects (6+ months in length), including contributing to the roadmap for complex projects spanning multiple teams and functions

### Preferred qualifications

- Comfortable and excited about AI tools from across the industry, with a good understanding of how they’re already changing the way developers work
- Ability to confidently craft and advocate for new design patterns and interaction models, and think beyond the current design system
- Ability to reduce complex problems down to the right balance of flexibility, power, and ease of use, especially when explaining complicated developer experiences to non-technical stakeholders
- Understanding and experience with the developer tooling landscape and what tools developers are using today
- Deep curiosity about the developer space, and a willingness to get your hands dirty in code
- Ability to leverage AI tools to prototype your ideas and rapidly iterate/share with others
- Experience working horizontally across a company to influence change and advocate for your ideas, product, and space
- Skilled in translating complexity, your work, process, and decisions to cross-functional stakeholders
- Comfortable presenting work to senior stakeholders
- Passionate about helping other designers grow their confidence and expertise using AI in their process, leading by example
- Experience working at a startup or a small, fast-moving experimental team within a larger organization

## Working remotely at Stripe

A remote location is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently live or plan to live.

## Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $188,100 - $282,100. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings ("OTE") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.
