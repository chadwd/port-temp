\* Influence product and business direction, working with senior leadership to identify opportunities where design and AI can transform customer outcomes.  
\* Define and drive cross-service design standards such as interaction models, experience principles, and reusable patterns to ensure consistency.  
\* Mentor and elevate the design org, coaching other designers and raising the overall quality of craft, storytelling, and execution.  
\* Prototype and explore new AI paradigms, collaborating with applied scientists and engineers to validate bold ideas and shape next-generation interfaces.  
\* Be a thought leader inside and outside AWS, evangelizing design excellence and the responsible adoption of AI through storytelling, writing, and cross-org forums.

## Basic Qualifications

\* 12+ years in UX design, with a track record of leading large-scale, complex, customer-facing services.  
\* Proven ability to define and execute design strategies at scale, balancing user needs, technical constraints, and business goals.  
\* Strong systems thinker, capable of architecting frameworks and reusable solutions that unify experiences across diverse services.  
\* Demonstrated success in influencing senior leaders and driving alignment across multiple organizations.  
\* Exceptional storytelling skills, including visual, verbal, and written, able to inspire and align both executives and builders.  
\* Experience mentoring and elevating senior-level design talent.  
\* Familiarity with AI-assisted design workflows and the ability to collaborate with applied science and ML teams.

## Preferred Qualifications

\* Proven track record shipping AI-first or AI-powered products that solved meaningful customer problems.  
\* Experience designing for trust, transparency, and human-in-the-loop systems.  
\* Ability to prototype and explore with LLMs, intelligent agents, or other AI frameworks.  
\* Strong background in data-informed design, leveraging UX research, analytics, and A/B testing to drive decisions.
