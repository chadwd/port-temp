Coinbase Platform Design Team
Remote - United States

Dear Coinbase Hiring Team,

I'm applying for the Senior Staff Product Designer, Platform role because I want to help Coinbase build the onchain platform—the infrastructure for the global financial system. I care about this mission in a practical way: I've been an active crypto user since 2023 and have supported clearer, pro-innovation policy in the U.S. I want this technology built responsibly, in the open, with a high bar for security and trust.

I'm a staff-level, systems-minded product designer with 15+ years across enterprise and platform products. I build reusable patterns, tokens, and component rules that reduce fragmentation. I align product vision with engineering implementation through clear states, acceptance criteria, and dev-ready specs. I ship reliably on high-stakes work by turning ambiguity into phased plans that Product and Engineering can execute while protecting usability, edge cases, and customer trust.

I also push practical AI workflows that accelerate delivery without cutting corners. I've been building AI-assisted design-to-code workflows (Figma MCP + Claude Code) to reduce handoff confusion and shorten cycle time, treating AI as a quality multiplier with guardrails.

If we work together, I will take responsibility for outcomes that matter in Platform: reducing UX drift across surfaces, improving trust in complex flows, increasing velocity through better design-to-dev clarity, and mentoring designers to level up systems thinking and craft.

I would love to talk. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Chad Dunbar
