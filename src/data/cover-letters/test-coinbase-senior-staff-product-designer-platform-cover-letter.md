Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm a Staff Product Designer with 10+ years designing enterprise platforms at GM Financial and Scale AI, with expertise in design systems, AI-assisted workflows, and cross-functional leadership. I'm writing to express my interest in the Senior Staff Product Designer - Platform position at Coinbase, drawn by your mission to build the infrastructure for the future global financial system and your commitment to scalable design thinking across complex product ecosystems.

Over the past decade, I've led design systems architecture across multiple enterprise platforms, shipped a CEO-level pricing initiative with 88.7% retention, and reduced design-to-dev cycle time from 20-45 days to 2-4 days using AI-assisted workflows. I'd like to highlight two experiences that demonstrate my fit for the Platform Design team.

At Scale AI, I led design systems architecture and component foundations that reduced visual drift across multiple enterprise platforms. I established token alignment, naming standards, and governance frameworks adopted across a 3-person design systems team, achieving 200% growth in team participation. This required the same scalable pattern thinking Coinbase needs to unify consumer and advanced crypto experiences—creating systems that work across vastly different user contexts without compromising either experience.

Earlier, I stabilized a CEO-level enterprise pricing initiative at GM Financial that onboarded 210 new rooftops while maintaining 88.7% dealer retention. I introduced phased delivery models aligned across Product, Engineering, and Research, delivering componentized pricing logic enabling white-labeling, extensibility, and compliance. This project taught me how to influence stakeholders across an organization, navigate executive visibility, and deliver complex enterprise products—the strategic design leadership Coinbase expects at the Senior Staff level.

I'm drawn to Coinbase's role in building accessible financial infrastructure for a global audience. Your focus on serving both crypto newcomers and sophisticated users resonates with my work balancing novice dealers and multi-rooftop operators—different domains, but the same challenge of translating complexity into intuitive experiences. Additionally, your interest in experimenting with AI tools for prototyping aligns with my recent work cutting design cycles by 90% through AI-assisted workflows, and I'm excited to push those boundaries further.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience designing scalable enterprise platforms could contribute to Coinbase's product ecosystem. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Chad Dunbar
