## Professional Experience

### ACV Auctions - Staff Product Designer | **Jan 2017 – Present**

#### **AI-Native Design Patterns & Agent Prototyping**

* Established reusable AI UX patterns adopted across multiple product surfaces by framing AI output as decision support rather than opaque automation, directly addressing trust and adoption challenges
* Improved user trust during AI processing delays with lower abandonment rates during long-running operations by designing transparent, expectation-setting loading and progress states
* Reduced design-to-development cycle time from multi-week cycles to days in pilot initiatives by designing and leading AI-assisted workflows using intelligent agents (Claude Code, Figma MCP) that validated system constraints early
* Prototype with intelligent agents for production releases, collaborating with engineering teams to ship AI-powered features rather than theoretical explorations

#### **Cross-Service Design Systems & Standards**

* Increased adoption and consistency of shared UI components, reducing visual drift and implementation ambiguity across products, by leading component architecture, naming standards, and design system foundations
* Established sustainable design system operations with clear ownership, contribution models, and measurable outcomes by defining purpose-driven governance frameworks tied to business value
* Defined cross-product design standards and reusable patterns that unified experiences across enterprise pricing, retail tools, and dealer platforms serving 16,000+ dealers nationwide
