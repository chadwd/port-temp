## The Problem They're Solving

TRM Labs builds blockchain intelligence tools for governments, financial institutions, and crypto companies tackling critical challenges: human trafficking, financial fraud, terrorist financing. They need a Senior Product Designer who can own the design process end-to-end AND build the design systems infrastructure to scale rapidly.

**Their biggest pain points:**

1. **Speed-to-ship pressure:** "If it takes months elsewhere, it often ships here in days." They need someone who can move fast without sacrificing quality.

2. **Design systems at scale:** They explicitly call out "create and maintain design systems, workflows, and tools that enable rapid execution and consistency." This isn't a nice-to-have—it's core to the role.

3. **Cross-functional influence:** They want someone who can "champion user-centered design across the organization, influencing product strategy." This is a culture-building role, not just IC execution.

4. **90-day impact expectation:** "Rapidly onboard to TRM's product and business to begin delivering value within the first 90 days." They're betting on slope and fast ramp-up.

5. **Mission-critical stakes:** "The clock is running and the consequences are real." They need someone who can handle high-stakes product decisions with conviction.

## Gaps to Address Honestly

**Requirements you don't directly show:**

- **Blockchain/crypto domain expertise:**
  - **Transferable:** Your profile mentions "hands-on experience with trading platforms, decentralized protocols, and wallet-based workflows" in personal_expertise.fintech_crypto
  - **Honest framing:** "My blockchain experience is hands-on as a user and investor, not professional product design. I understand the mental models—wallets, gas, on-chain vs off-chain—but would be learning their specific intelligence tooling from scratch. My 90-day ramp-up would focus heavily on domain immersion."

- **B2B security/compliance product design (government, financial institutions):**
  - **Transferable:** You've delivered enterprise products with compliance constraints (componentized logic, extensibility, compliance needs), HIPAA-adjacent requirements at scale
  - **Honest framing:** "I've designed for enterprise compliance in automotive—pricing logic, multi-location governance, audit requirements—but not intelligence/security products specifically. The pattern of 'high-stakes decision support for non-technical users' transfers well."

- **Startup velocity proof:**
  - **Transferable:** Your AI workflow results (20-45 days → 2-4 days) demonstrate compression, but at an established company
  - **Honest framing:** "My velocity metrics come from enterprise context, not startup chaos. I'd be adapting those practices to TRM's leaner structure. My approach—validating constraints early, reducing downstream rework—should translate, but I'd need to recalibrate for their specific tooling and team structure."

**Level expectations:**
- Title is "Senior" not "Staff"—your accomplishments may read as overqualified. Consider whether to position as "stepping into IC-heavy role after staff-level experience" or if this signals a mismatch in scope expectations.

## Your Narrative Arc

**Opening hook (pick one based on interview read):**

1. **If they emphasize speed:**
   "I've compressed design-to-dev cycles from weeks to days using AI-assisted workflows. At TRM, I'd bring that velocity mindset to your design systems and delivery process."

2. **If they emphasize design systems:**
   "I've built design system operations from scratch—governance, contribution models, adoption metrics—for products used by 40+ enterprise clients. I know how to create infrastructure that scales without becoming a bottleneck."

3. **If they emphasize mission:**
   "I've delivered under CEO-level visibility with enterprise clients where mistakes had real financial consequences. Your mission—building tools that stop human trafficking and financial fraud—resonates with me. I want my work to matter."

**Core positioning:**
You're a Staff-level designer with 15+ years of enterprise platform experience who can run end-to-end design *and* build the design systems infrastructure TRM needs to scale. Your AI-assisted workflow experience makes you a velocity multiplier. Your enterprise background means you understand high-stakes product decisions where users are making critical calls with imperfect information.

**Differentiator:**
Most designers at this level are either strong ICs OR systems thinkers. You're both: you've shipped complex enterprise products end-to-end AND built the design systems infrastructure that makes teams faster. That combination is rare.

## Talking Points Summary

**Lead with these 3 in conversation:**
1. "I reduced design-to-dev cycles from 20+ days to 2-4 days using AI-assisted validation workflows."
2. "I built design system governance that increased team participation 200% while reducing visual drift across products."
3. "I delivered an enterprise pricing platform under CEO visibility with 88.7% retention and 210 new locations."

**Address gaps proactively:**
- **Blockchain:** "I'm a hands-on crypto user—I understand wallets, on-chain/off-chain, defi workflows—but my professional design work has been enterprise automotive. I'd plan a 90-day deep dive into blockchain intelligence tooling."
- **Seniority level:** "I'm excited about a Senior IC role where I can focus on execution and craft. My Staff background means I can contribute to design culture and systems thinking, but I want to ship—not just delegate."

**Questions to ask them:**
- "What does 'design systems at TRM' mean today? Is there existing infrastructure, or is this greenfield?"
- "When you say 'ship in days not months,' what's a recent example? I want to understand the actual velocity expectations."
- "How does the design function interface with the investigations/intelligence side? Do designers have access to real case data, or is it abstracted?"
