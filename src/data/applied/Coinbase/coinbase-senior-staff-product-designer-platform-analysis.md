## The Problem They're Solving

Coinbase needs a senior design leader who can operate across multiple product areas simultaneously, creating scalable patterns that drive consistency while navigating the complexity of crypto/blockchain products for both beginners and advanced users. They're building the infrastructure for the future global financial system, which requires someone who can translate complexity into intuitive experiences at massive scale.

**Their biggest pain points:**
1. **Cross-product fragmentation** - Need scalable design systems and patterns that work across consumer and advanced crypto products
2. **Complexity gap** - Products must serve both crypto newcomers and sophisticated users without sacrificing either experience
3. **Strategic design leadership** - Need senior influence to shape product vision and drive measurable business outcomes across the company
4. **Speed and quality balance** - Must ship with "reliable consistency" while maintaining craft standards in a high-intensity, fast-moving environment

## Gaps to Address Honestly

**Requirements you don't directly show:**

- **Consumer-facing product experience** (They specify "10+ years designing consumer-facing products")
  - **Transferable:** Your enterprise platform work includes dealer-facing tools with significant UX complexity, but you lack direct B2C consumer product experience at scale
  - **Honest framing:** "My 8 years at ACV Auctions focused on enterprise B2B platforms rather than consumer-facing products. While the platform complexity and scale are comparable, I haven't designed for the millions of retail users Coinbase serves daily. However, my enterprise work includes balancing novice and expert user needs—dealers range from single-location owners to multi-rooftop operators with sophisticated requirements."

- **Crypto/blockchain domain knowledge** (Listed as "Nice to Have" but likely table stakes)
  - **Transferable:** You have hands-on fintech/trading platform experience noted in profile ("personal expertise: fintech_crypto"), but not professional crypto product design experience
  - **Honest framing:** "I'm a crypto user with hands-on experience in trading platforms and wallet workflows, providing real user empathy. However, I haven't professionally designed crypto products. I understand the domain as a user, but would need to ramp on Coinbase-specific product nuances and blockchain technical constraints."

- **Proven user research leadership** (They want "experience conducting user research studies")
  - **Transferable:** Your profile shows "Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD), Usability testing collaboration, Insight synthesis" but emphasizes collaboration rather than direct research leadership
  - **Honest framing:** "I partner closely with researchers and synthesize insights to inform design decisions, but I'm not a research practitioner. I excel at translating research findings into clear design direction, as demonstrated in the Atlas pricing initiative."

**Level expectations:**

- **Senior Staff scope:** The role expects company-wide influence and strategic impact across multiple product areas. Your accomplishments show strong Staff-level platform work, but most examples are within a single company ecosystem (ACV) rather than demonstrating breadth across diverse product lines.
  - **Evidence you DO have:** CEO-level initiative ownership, design systems governance, cross-functional leadership, and mentorship at scale
  - **Growth edge:** Expanding from deep expertise in one complex domain (auto wholesale) to breadth across crypto's diverse product surfaces (consumer wallets, institutional trading, staking, DeFi, etc.)

## Your Narrative Arc

**Opening hook (pick one based on their biggest pain):**

1. **If emphasizing design systems/platform scale:** "I've spent the last 8 years building enterprise platform products where consistency and scalability aren't nice-to-haves—they're survival requirements. At ACV, I led design systems architecture that unified experiences across 4 major products while maintaining the velocity to ship 155+ UX tasks annually. That's the kind of systems thinking Coinbase needs to scale crypto adoption."

2. **If emphasizing AI innovation/speed:** "I reduced our design-to-dev cycle from 20-45 days to 2-4 days using AI-assisted workflows—not by cutting corners, but by fundamentally rethinking how design and engineering collaborate. That same innovation mindset is exactly what Coinbase needs to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving crypto space."

3. **If emphasizing strategic leadership:** "I've stabilized CEO-level initiatives with 88.7% retention while shipping the highest volume of UX work on my team—proving you don't have to choose between strategic impact and execution velocity. Coinbase needs someone who can operate at both altitudes simultaneously."

**Core positioning:**

You're a Staff-level platform designer who brings enterprise-grade systems thinking to high-velocity environments. While your domain expertise is auto wholesale rather than crypto, the core challenges are identical: building scalable design systems for products serving both novices and experts, maintaining quality under pressure, and influencing strategic decisions across Product, Engineering, and Research. Your unique edge is combining proven platform leadership with cutting-edge AI workflow experimentation—you're building the future of design execution while delivering consistent business value today.

**Differentiator:**

"Most Senior Staff designers are either systems thinkers OR high-velocity shippers. I've proven I can do both: I led design systems architecture that scaled across 4 products while maintaining the highest UX output on my team (155 tasks/year). Add in my AI workflow innovation that cut cycle time by 73%, and you get someone who doesn't just adapt to the future of design—I'm actively building it."

## Talking Points Summary

**Lead with these 3 in conversation:**

1. **Design systems at platform scale:** "I led design systems architecture across 4 enterprise products with 200% team participation growth—the same scalable pattern thinking Coinbase needs to unify consumer and advanced crypto experiences."

2. **AI workflow innovation:** "I cut design-to-dev cycle time from 20-45 days to 2-4 days using AI-assisted workflows with Figma MCP and Claude Code—proving I'm already pushing the boundaries of what's possible in design execution."

3. **Strategic execution velocity:** "I stabilized a CEO-level enterprise initiative with 88.7% retention while shipping the highest UX volume on my team—demonstrating I operate effectively at both strategic and tactical altitudes."

**Address gaps proactively:**

- **Consumer product gap:** "My enterprise platform experience is deep, but I haven't designed consumer-facing products at Coinbase's scale. However, my work balancing novice dealers and sophisticated multi-rooftop operators gives me a foundation for serving both crypto newcomers and advanced users. I'd need to ramp on consumer product patterns, but the core UX principles transfer."

- **Crypto domain:** "I'm a crypto user with hands-on fintech experience, so I have real user empathy—but I haven't professionally designed crypto products. I understand blockchain from a user perspective and could contribute immediately on platform/systems work while ramping on Coinbase-specific product nuances. I'm upfront that I'd have a learning curve on deep crypto mechanics."

**Questions to ask them:**

1. **Understanding their systems maturity:** "You mention partnering with Design Systems teams to create scalable patterns—where is Coinbase's design system today in terms of maturity and adoption? What are the biggest friction points in getting teams to adopt consistent patterns?"

2. **Strategic design influence:** "The role describes influencing strategy across the company—can you share an example of how a Senior Staff designer recently shaped product direction at Coinbase? What does 'good' look like at this level?"

3. **Consumer vs. platform balance:** "The Platform Design team supports products across the company—how do you balance serving consumer-facing products versus more technical/institutional surfaces? Where do you see the biggest design leverage opportunities?"

4. **AI experimentation culture:** "You want someone experimenting with AI tools for prototyping and ideation—what's Coinbase's current posture on AI-assisted design workflows? Are teams actively exploring this, or would I be pioneering it?"
