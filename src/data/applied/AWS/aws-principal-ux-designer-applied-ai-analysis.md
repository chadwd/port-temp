## Gaps to Address Honestly

**Requirements you don't directly show:**

- **Principal-level scope across multiple services**
  - **Gap:** Your experience shows staff-level ownership within a single company's platform. AWS expects vision and strategy across multiple AWS services at Amazon scale, not ACV Auctions scale.
  - **Transferable:** You've led design systems work that unified multiple product surfaces and stabilized cross-team initiatives during organizational change—similar systems-thinking, different magnitude.
  - **Honest framing:** "My systems thinking has scaled across products within a mid-market SaaS company (ACV). The leap to principal-level scope across AWS services is exactly the growth edge I'm targeting—same architectural mindset, larger canvas."

- **Influencing senior leadership at Amazon scale**
  - **Gap:** You work directly with VP/Director-level leadership weekly at ACV. AWS expects the same level of influence but across multiple organizations at one of the world's largest tech companies.
  - **Transferable:** You stabilized high-visibility CEO-level initiatives, drove alignment during instability, and have regular VP/Director engagement—you already operate at this leadership level, just at different organizational scale.
  - **Honest framing:** "I work with VP/Director-level leaders weekly at ACV, influencing product strategy and driving alignment. Amazon's scale is different, but I'm already operating at the executive level—the muscle is there, I'm ready for the larger organizational scope."

- **Thought leadership and evangelism**
  - **Gap:** The role expects "published talks, writings, or community engagement" and "evangelizing design excellence inside and outside AWS." Your profile doesn't show external thought leadership.
  - **Transferable:** You've institutionalized documentation, mentored designers through workshops, and established governance frameworks—you know how to teach and codify design thinking.
  - **Honest framing:** "My thought leadership has been internal (mentorship, documentation, governance). Scaling that to external evangelism—talks, writing, cross-org forums—is a growth opportunity I'm excited about."

- **Prototyping with LLMs and intelligent agents**
  - **Gap:** None. You work directly with agents through Claude Code to prototype real released products, combining Figma MCP + AI agents for design-to-dev workflows.
  - **Your proof:** You're prototyping with intelligent agents in production—not in a lab. You understand agent capabilities, constraints, and how to design workflows that leverage them effectively.
  - **Honest framing:** "I prototype with intelligent agents through Claude Code for production releases. I design AI-assisted workflows that ship to real customers, not just proof-of-concepts. I understand agent capabilities because I work with them daily."

**Level expectations:**

- **12+ years experience:** You meet this (15+ years).
- **"Leading large-scale, complex, customer-facing services":** Your scale is mid-market SaaS, not AWS "millions of customers" scale. Be transparent that you're stepping up in magnitude, not starting from zero.
- **"Demonstrated success influencing senior leaders across multiple organizations":** You work with VP/Director-level leaders weekly at ACV across Product/Eng/Research. The gap is organizational scale (single company vs. multiple AWS business units), not leadership level.

## Your Narrative Arc

**Opening hook (pick one based on interviewer focus):**

1. **If they emphasize AI-native design:** "I've spent the last two years building reusable AI UX patterns that frame AI as decision support, not black-box automation. Those patterns shipped in production, lowered abandonment during AI processing, and scaled across multiple product surfaces—exactly the trust-building, AI-native design AWS needs at scale."

2. **If they emphasize systems thinking and standards:** "I've led design systems work that reduced visual drift across enterprise products and established governance frameworks tied to business value. At AWS, I'd apply that same systems architecture mindset to define interaction models and reusable patterns across multiple AI-powered services."

3. **If they emphasize mentorship and org elevation:** "I've elevated 3 junior designers to senior roles in 12 months through strategic coaching and scenario-based training. At AWS, I'd scale that mentorship philosophy to raise the bar for the entire design org—coaching designers, not just shipping pixels."

**Core positioning:**

I'm a staff designer who prototypes with intelligent agents (Claude Code) for production releases, works with VP/Director-level leaders weekly, and has built AI-native UX patterns and platform design systems at mid-market SaaS scale. The leap to principal at AWS is about organizational scale, not capability—I already operate at the executive level with hands-on agent prototyping, systems thinking, and trust-centered AI design. I'm targeting this role because it's the right growth edge: same architectural mindset and leadership muscle, larger organizational canvas, and the chance to define how AI and design intersect at global scale.

**Differentiator:**

Most principal designers theorize about AI or prototype in labs. I ship AI-powered products to production using intelligent agents daily. I've built reusable AI UX patterns, enterprise-grade componentized systems with compliance constraints, AND I prototype with agents (Claude Code) to validate AI workflows before they ship. I understand how to make AI trustworthy at scale because I work with agents in production, not in isolation.

## Talking Points Summary

**Lead with these 3 in conversation:**

1. **Hands-on agent prototyping in production:** "I prototype with intelligent agents through Claude Code to ship production releases. I've built AI-assisted workflows that reduced design-to-dev cycles from weeks to days, and I understand agent capabilities because I work with them daily—not in a lab, but shipping to real customers."

2. **AI-native design with trust-building patterns:** "I've built reusable AI UX patterns that shipped in production, lowered abandonment during AI processing, and scaled across multiple product surfaces by framing AI as decision support rather than opaque automation."

3. **VP/Director-level engagement with systems thinking:** "I work with VP/Director-level leaders weekly, leading design systems work that reduced visual drift across enterprise products—the same architectural mindset and leadership level AWS needs, just at larger organizational scale."

**Address gaps proactively:**

- **Organizational scale:** "I work with VP/Director-level leaders weekly and operate at principal-level scope within ACV. The leap to AWS is about organizational scale—multiple services across Amazon's ecosystem vs. multiple products within one company. The leadership muscle is there; I'm ready for the larger canvas."

- **Thought leadership:** "My thought leadership has been internal—documentation, mentorship, governance. Scaling that to external evangelism through talks and writing is a growth opportunity I'm excited about."

**Questions to ask them:**

- "How does AWS Applied AI Solutions balance bold AI paradigm exploration with the need for turnkey, opinionated solutions that customers trust immediately?"

- "What does 'setting the bar for AI-native design' look like in practice when you're working across multiple services with different maturity levels and customer expectations?"

- "How does the principal designer role navigate influencing product/business strategy while also diving deep into interaction models and experience principles?"

- "What does success look like in the first 6-12 months for this role—is it shipping AI patterns, establishing design standards, mentoring the org, or a combination?"

**Next Steps:**

1. **Review each match above** - Verify the "why this matters" reasoning aligns with your understanding of your work
2. **Prepare honest gap response** - Practice framing the organizational scale gap (ACV → AWS) confidently; only remaining gap is external thought leadership
3. **Memorize talking points** - These are your opening moves in any conversation about this role
4. **Decide if this is the right fit** - 75-80% match with weekly VP/Director engagement and hands-on agent prototyping is very strong. The only gaps are organizational scale and external thought leadership.

**Reality check:** This role expects principal-level scope across multiple AWS services at Amazon scale. You already operate at principal-level leadership (weekly VP/Director engagement, hands-on agent prototyping, systems thinking, cross-org influence) within ACV. The gap is organizational scale, not capability—same muscle, bigger stage. You're a strong candidate if you can articulate why you're ready for the larger canvas.

**Note:** This is analysis only. You decide which accomplishments to emphasize and how to position yourself.
