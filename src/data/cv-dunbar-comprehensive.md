#### AI-Enabled Workflows & Dev Acceleration

- **Reduced design-to-development cycle time by ~70%** (from 30-60 days to 10-15 days in pilot) by directing Project N.E.X.T., an AI-assisted workflow using Figma MCP and Claude Code with documented prompting patterns

- **Reduced handoff iterations from 3-5 cycles to 1 cycle** by establishing repeatable code validation workflows and auto-generated component previews

- **Outperformed 90% industry abandonment baseline** during AI inference delays by designing trust-building loading states with "thinking" metaphors, clear disclaimers, and contextual messaging

- **Systemized AI UX patterns into reusable components and playbooks** with evidence-first recommendation structure (Insights → Summary → Recommendation) adopted for Pace Notes

- **Established reusable AI loading state standard** shipped to production July 2025, becoming baseline for 2026 A/B validation by reframing slow inference waits as computationally valuable with transparent, trust-preserving tone

- **Shipped functional code in production repository** from AI-assisted design pilot with working PR merged and documented prompting patterns by integrating Claude Code with Figma MCP

- **Established PR-ready code as official design artifact** with senior engineering review becoming standard handoff practice by using AI to surface system constraints and validate behavior earlier

#### Platform & Design Systems Leadership

- **Accelerated design system component adoption** with token alignment reducing pixel drift and handoff ambiguity in NCP and Retail surfaces by leading Calculator component architecture

- **Increased design system contribution and engagement by 200%** by re-architecting fragmented DS across 6+ platforms into federated model with centralized tokens and product-owned libraries

- **Grew wholesale transaction volume from 12% to 22%** by designing guaranteed offer acceptance experience that eliminated dealer risk and streamlined valuation-to-wholesale path

- **Created multi-surface design coordination forum** (MAXClearCar Design, 10+ members) for shared components and migration paths

- **Prepared design system components for cross-industry reuse** with white-labeling exercises and AG Grid integration completed in Calculator component

- **Instrumented mobile workflow with behavioral analytics** (starts/completions/errors telemetry) for Take Into Inventory flow validated with UAT/pilot dealers

- **Established sustainable design system operations** with codified purpose, KPIs, ownership, and publish workflows adopted by 3-person DS team using "Purpose, Process, Profit" framework

- **Mentored designers** on scalable component architecture, quality bars, and DS governance workflows improving implementation readiness across MAX and Retail products

#### Enterprise Product Ownership

- **Stabilized CEO-level New Car Pricing initiative** achieving 88.7% dealer retention and 210 new rooftops onboarded by introducing phased sequencing models adopted by Product, Engineering, and Research

- **Delivered enterprise-ready pricing platform** with componentized complex pricing logic enabling white-labeling and syndication by translating research on incentives, compliance, and auditability into clear UX frameworks

- **Shipped complete feature from research to production** (Appraisal Alerts) with Atlas "Completed" status and zero rework loops by owning end-to-end including JTBD, lifecycle logic, notification design, and dev handoff

- **Achieved competitive parity with vAuto** in new car pricing by delivering integrated rebates, accessories, and pricing rules matching/exceeding competitor capabilities

- **Delivered Chrome integration for rebate management** with per-unit rebate control and OEM/third-party feed syndication

- **Validated Appraisal Alerts UX through original research synthesis** with research guide and moment-of-insight clips aligning MVP to dealer mental models

- **Enabled one-click wholesale acceptance from dealer UI** with higher conversion from estimate to accepted offer and reduced manual outreach by designing Request Inspection and Accept Offer workflows

#### Cross-Functional Execution & Outcomes

- **Delivered highest output on UX team** (155 UX initiatives, 116 CapEx) while maintaining dev-ready clarity with states, acceptance criteria, and error logic across multiple product lines

- **Maintained zero roadmap slips** across MAX, Retail, Alerts, and NCP despite team instability by building operational clarity systems and weekly visibility updates

- **Reduced late-stage project surprises** with improved scoping accuracy and fewer rework loops by establishing early edge-case review and shared decision criteria

- **Created ACV's first organizational alignment system (HOME)** with weekly visibility into What, Why, Success, Risks, and Decisions adopted across teams

- **Maintained research and design continuity** during multiple team absences with no roadmap slips or delivery gaps by absorbing UXR responsibilities during dual researcher medical leaves

- **Introduced dual-track Research and Design execution model** with MVP/V2/V3 sequencing adopted by VP Product, PM, Engineering, and UXR for NCP initiative

- **Codified design system operating principles and naming standards** adopted as reference for DS team and future component creation

- **Institutionalized UX visibility across ACV Retail** with weekly HOME/Confluence updates becoming standard operating practice

- **Created reusable onboarding and stakeholder materials** with structured walkthrough deck adopted for training and cross-team alignment

- **Established auditable documentation practices** with all impact claims linked to traceable artifacts (Atlas, Confluence, Jira, UXR)

- **Formalized defensible design decision history** with feedback log system tracking iterations, stakeholder input, and rationales

- **Standardized dev handoff checklists** adopted for engineering intake covering states, tokens, a11y, and acceptance tests
