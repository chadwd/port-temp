PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

ACV Auctions - Product Designer (Principal-level scope)
ACV Retail | January 2017 - Present

AI Workflows & Trust UX

* Reduced design-to-development cycle from 30-60 days to 10-15 days (~70% reduction) by directing Project N.E.X.T., an AI-assisted workflow using Figma MCP and Claude Code with documented prompting patterns

* Outperformed 90% industry abandonment baseline during AI inference delays (10-60 seconds) by designing trust-building loading states with "thinking" metaphors, transparent messaging, and clear disclaimers

* Systemized AI UX patterns into reusable components and playbooks by reframing AI output from prescriptive automation to "evidence-first" recommendation structure (Insights to Summary to Recommendation)

* Established PR-ready code as official design artifact - senior engineering now reviews designer-generated code as standard handoff practice, eliminating translation layer between design and implementation

Enterprise Platform Leadership

* Achieved 88.7% dealer retention and onboarded 210 new rooftops by leading UX for New Car Pricing, a CEO-level enterprise platform with componentized pricing logic, rebate management, and multi-stakeholder workflows

* Delivered 155 UX initiatives (116 CapEx) with high reliability, the highest output on UX team, by maintaining dev-ready clarity with states, acceptance criteria, and error logic across multiple product lines

* Maintained zero roadmap slips across MAX, Retail, Alerts, and NCP during team instability by absorbing research responsibilities during dual researcher medical leaves and building operational clarity systems

Design Systems & Cross-Functional Execution

* Increased design system contribution and engagement by 200% by re-architecting fragmented DS across 6+ platforms into federated model with centralized tokens and product-owned libraries

* Introduced dual-track Research and Design execution model with MVP/V2/V3 phased sequencing - adopted by VP Product, PM, Engineering, and UXR for New Car Pricing initiative

* Reduced design-engineering handoff iterations from 3-5 cycles to 1 by establishing repeatable code validation workflows and auto-generated component previews


Rand McNally - Lead Product Designer
January 2013 - January 2017

* Designed and developed WorldAtlas, a web-based geography teaching platform for K-12 classrooms aligned with Common Core and National Geography Standards, serving teachers and students across desktop and mobile devices

* Combined design and front-end development responsibilities, delivering production-ready education platform with design-to-code ownership

* Unified design direction across product lines by introducing scalable UI standards and style guides for web and mobile platforms
