PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

ACV Auctions - Product Designer (Principal-level scope) | January 2017 - Present
Retail Platforms, MAX Digital, ClearCar

- Outperformed 90% industry abandonment baseline during AI inference delays (10-60 seconds) by designing trust-building loading states with "thinking" metaphors, clear disclaimers, and contextual messaging-making ambiguous AI processes feel transparent and trustworthy

- Reduced design-to-development cycle time from 20-45 days to 2-4 days by directing Project N.E.X.T., an AI-assisted workflow using Figma MCP and Claude Code with documented prompting patterns that accelerate design-to-code handoffs

- Achieved 88.7% dealer retention and onboarded 210 new rooftops for New Car Pricing, a CEO-level enterprise platform initiative, by introducing phased sequencing models and translating complex pricing logic (incentives, compliance, auditability) into componentized, scalable UX frameworks

- Maintained zero roadmap slips across MAX, Retail, Alerts, and NCP during team instability by absorbing research responsibilities, building operational clarity systems, and creating weekly visibility updates-demonstrating execution through ambiguity without sacrificing quality

- Established sustainable design system operations with codified purpose, KPIs, and publish workflows adopted by 3-person DS team by creating "Purpose, Process, Profit" framework that tied design system to measurable business value

- Reduced design-engineering handoff iterations from 3-5 cycles to 1 cycle by establishing repeatable code validation workflows and auto-generated component previews using AI-assisted tooling

- Delivered 155 UX initiatives (116 CapEx) with high reliability and low rework-the highest output on UX team-by maintaining dev-ready clarity (states, acceptance criteria, error logic) across multiple product lines

- Shipped Appraisal Alerts with zero rework loops and Atlas "Completed" status by owning the feature end-to-end from JTBD research synthesis to lifecycle logic, notification design, and dev-ready handoff

- Increased service lane vehicles sold by 231% in five months (210 to 696) by reducing friction in photo, inspection, and workflow tooling for ClearCar-directly improving dealer throughput and revenue


Rand McNally - Lead Product Designer | January 2013 - January 2017

- Designed web-based education platform for K-12 teachers by building scalable curriculum management and classroom tools, introducing UI standards and interaction patterns that improved cross-team consistency across navigation and education product lines

- Improved engineering delivery quality and performance at scale by partnering closely with engineering teams on design direction for consumer navigation and education products serving millions of teachers and students
