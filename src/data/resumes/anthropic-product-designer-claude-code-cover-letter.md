Hiring Team
Anthropic
San Francisco, CA

**Re: Product Designer, Claude Code**

---

I'm a Claude Code power user who's already shipped the exact type of work you're hiring for—designing AI workflow patterns in production.

Over the past year at ACV Auctions, I've reduced our design-to-dev cycle by 70% (from 30-60 days to 10-15 days) using Claude Code and Figma MCP. I didn't just theorize about agentic AI UX—I built it, shipped it, and used the tool I'd now be designing to accelerate my own workflow. That's rare user empathy: I understand Claude Code from both sides of the screen.

**Why I'm the right fit for inventing agentic AI patterns:**

Your job description emphasizes that "agentic AI UX patterns don't exist yet." I've already solved core challenges you're facing:

- **Trust-building during autonomous operations:** I designed loading states for 10-60 second AI inference delays that outperformed the 90% industry abandonment baseline. The pattern shipped to production in July 2025 and became our reusable standard. I understand how to keep users confident when AI is working autonomously.

- **AI output framing for professional judgment:** I systemized AI UX patterns by reframing output from prescriptive automation to judgment support (Insights → Summary → Recommendation). This shipped in our Pace Notes feature. I know the nuance of when AI should be confident vs. tentative.

- **Code as a design artifact:** I ship PR-ready code validated by senior engineering. I reduced handoff iterations from 3-5 cycles to 1 by prototyping in code rather than static mockups. I won't slow down your fast-moving research cycles—I'll keep pace with weekly model improvements.

**Why I'm the right fit for multi-surface developer tools:**

You need someone who can maintain cohesion across terminal, IDE extensions, web, and Slack while shipping fast. I've coordinated design consistency across fragmented platforms before:

- Created a 10+ person multi-surface design forum (MAXClearCar Design) to align shared components and migration paths across MAX and ClearCar products
- Re-architected a fragmented design system across 6+ platforms into a federated model with centralized tokens, increasing team participation by 200%
- Delivered 155 UX initiatives (116 CapEx) with the highest output on our team while maintaining craft standards—dev-ready specs, edge cases, error handling

I know how to build component libraries and governance processes when teams move fast.

**What I bring to your "building in public" culture:**

Developers scrutinize every interaction. I've designed for equally demanding users—enterprise dealers who catch every workflow inefficiency. My work includes:

- Documented prompting patterns and enablement artifacts for AI-assisted workflows
- Standardized dev handoff checklists covering states, tokens, accessibility, and acceptance tests
- "Show your work" culture with traceable artifacts linking every design decision to business outcomes

I ship with the rigor your developer audience expects.

**My honest gaps and how I'd address them:**

I haven't shipped a pure CLI or IDE extension. My Claude Code experience is as a power user designing AI workflows, not as a CLI designer. I'd lean on your team's existing terminal and IDE patterns while I build domain fluency in the first 60 days.

But here's my advantage: I'm already a user of the product I'd be designing. I know where Claude Code delights me and where it frustrates me. Most candidates will show CLI mockups. I'll show production AI patterns I shipped using Claude Code itself. That user empathy is hard to replicate.

**Why Anthropic, why now:**

Claude Code hit $1B ARR in 6 months by solving a real problem for developers. You're not building design tooling for designers—you're building developer tooling for people like me who live in terminals and think in systems. I want to design the tool I already rely on, and I want to invent the agentic AI patterns that don't exist yet.

I thrive in ambiguity. I stabilized a CEO-level enterprise initiative (88.7% retention, 210 new rooftops) by introducing phased sequencing models when requirements were unclear. I maintained zero roadmap slips across four product lines during team instability. Your "empirical science" culture and rapid model iteration don't intimidate me—that's where I do my best work.

I'd love to discuss how my AI workflow design experience and Claude Code power user perspective can help you invent the next generation of agentic developer tools.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

Chad Dunbar
