## Professional Experience

### ACV Auctions — Product Designer (Principal-level scope)
**ACV Retail** | January 2017 – Present

**AI Workflow Acceleration**

- Reduced design-to-development cycle from 30-60 days to 10-15 days (~70% reduction) by directing Project N.E.X.T., an AI-assisted workflow using Figma MCP and Claude Code that ships PR-ready code as official design artifacts
- Established PR-ready code as standard design artifact—senior engineering now reviews designer-generated code in handoff practice, eliminating translation layer between design and implementation
- Reduced design-engineering handoff iterations from 3-5 cycles to 1 by establishing repeatable code validation workflows and auto-generated component previews

**Platform Design Systems**

- Increased design system contribution and engagement by 200% by re-architecting fragmented DS across 6+ platforms into federated model with centralized tokens and product-owned component libraries
- Established sustainable design system operations with codified purpose, KPIs, and publish workflows by creating "Purpose, Process, Profit" framework adopted by 3-person DS team

**AI Product UX**

- Outperformed 90% industry abandonment baseline during AI inference delays (10-60 seconds) by designing trust-building loading states with "thinking" metaphors, transparent messaging, and clear disclaimers
