## Competency 1: Communication

### Narrative Summary

In 2025, I communicated with clarity, consistency, and structure across multiple teams during a year marked by shifting ownership, medical leave gaps, and rapidly evolving priorities. My focus was simple: reduce ambiguity, set shared expectations, and create communication systems that helped the entire organization move with confidence. Whether I was leading research narratives, aligning PM and Engineering on complex workflows, or writing documentation that became the single source of truth for leadership, I aimed to make communication a stabilizing force.

I brought this approach to every domain I worked in. With NCP, I introduced a timeline and phased delivery model that gave stakeholders a clear picture of how design, research, and engineering would converge. For Appraisal Alerts, I translated dealer interviews into actionable insights, JTBD framing, and detailed flow logic that made the user problem clear to everyone involved. In both cases, strong communication turned ambiguity into an aligned direction.

I also created operational communication systems that improved how the team collaborates. The HOME alignment project gave leadership reliable visibility into what we were building, why it mattered, and where risks existed. This reduced churn during periods of uncertainty and replaced fragmented conversations with structured updates.

My communication extended into design operations. I delivered dev-ready documentation with precise states, acceptance criteria, and error logic, enabling Engineering to scope and deliver work with fewer back-and-forth cycles. I mentored teammates on DS structure and naming conventions, strengthening their ability to communicate design intent clearly. During the 2025 Hackathon, I helped Mike apply the Design System tokens and components correctly, ensuring clarity and consistency under rapid prototyping conditions.

Across every project and partnership, I communicated with clarity, structure, and intention. My goal was to help teams make better decisions by ensuring everyone understood the problem, the plan, and the path forward.

## Competency 2: Overall Execution

### Narrative Summary

2025 required consistent and disciplined execution across shifting priorities, medical leave gaps, and major initiatives spanning MAX, ClearCar, Retail, Alerts, and emerging AI programs. I operated as a reliable execution engine by delivering complex work with clarity, accuracy, and speed while also strengthening the systems that support the entire design team. My focus remained steady: translate ambiguity into actionable plans, align partners early, and deliver dev-ready designs that move straight into production.

One example of this discipline is Appraisal Alerts, where I led research, UX strategy, flow design, lifecycle logic, and dev-ready handoff. Every requirement and constraint was accounted for, which enabled Atlas to mark the project "Completed" with no rework loops. I carried this same execution approach into Guaranteed Offer, AI loading-state design, and core MAX workflows.

My execution extended beyond feature delivery. I improved how the organization ships work by refining Jira intake, documenting the PDLC for design, defining dev-handoff standards, and providing early feasibility drafts for engineering. These systems created predictability during months with limited UXR capacity and during reporting-structure changes.

I also delivered at scale. With 155 total UX tasks and 116 Capex tasks, I was among the highest-output designers on the UX team, surpassing Lead-level contributors while maintaining accuracy and low rework. This consistency helped leadership trust that delivery remained stable even as priorities moved.

My execution directly supported several key business outcomes. Improvements across MAX and ClearCar contributed to increases in Vehicles Sold on ACV Wholesale via ACV MAX (+9%), Active Dealers (+3% YoY), New Dealers added (+249), and an 83% YoY increase in ACV Wholesale fees generated through MAX ($19.5M → $35.7M). Additionally, enhancements to ClearCar workflows supported a 231% increase in Service Lane vehicles sold within five months. These gains reflect the downstream impact of clearer workflows, reduced cognitive load, and scalable design patterns.

Future-proofing execution was also a priority. Through Project N.E.X.T., I built an early design-to-code acceleration framework using Figma MCP and Claude Code. Initial benchmark tests showed strong potential to reduce cycle time (20–45 days → target of 2–4 days), and I am working with engineering to validate these workflows on a new white-label component before the end of 2025.

Across all of these areas, my execution remained steady, predictable, and grounded in detail helping the design team ship confidently and maintain momentum during an uncertain year.

## Competency 3: Manages Customer Experience

### Narrative Summary

In 2025, I shaped customer experience by grounding every feature, workflow, and decision in clear user understanding and validated dealer behavior. My focus remained consistent: reduce cognitive load, remove friction, design for real operating environments, and ensure each experience supports how dealers source, price, and manage inventory at scale. Whether I was leading research myself or translating insights with a partner, my goal was to deliver experiences that were intuitive, trustworthy, and aligned with dealer expectations.

A flagship example is Appraisal Alerts, where I owned the complete customer experience from discovery through delivery. I conducted dealer interviews, defined JTBD, mapped operational pain points, and designed the full lifecycle for a feature that helps dealers avoid missed sourcing opportunities. The final solution reflects real dealership behavior alert rules grounded in precise thresholds, filters aligned to mental models, batching to prevent alert fatigue, and notification pathways that match urgency. This was full CX ownership end to end: research → synthesis → system logic → flows → validation → dev-ready handoff.

My work in New Car Pricing elevated customer value at an enterprise scale. Partnering with Jake M., acting research lead, I translated complex research findings into UX structures that support pricing accuracy, transparency, and auditability. The design centered dealer needs validated by UXR: a 5 out of 5 adoption score, extremely positive sentiment, high willingness to adopt and pay, desire for clear automation rules, compliance consistency, and bulk controls for multi-store groups. I ensured these insights shaped the experience itself, not just the requirements, resulting in a system that meets the expectations of large dealer organizations.

Across MAX and Retail, I strengthened the customer experience by improving essential workflows reducing friction in Guarantee Offer acceptance, designing trust-building AI loading states, refining IA for pricing and calculator tools, and improving error states that guide users without confusion. Through design system work, I protected experience quality at scale by leading key components, mentoring teammates, and documenting patterns that create consistent interactions across products.

Across all of these areas, I maintained a high bar for clarity, usability, accessibility, and operational alignment. I anchored every decision in the customer story, ensuring that product direction matched real-world dealer behavior and measurable user outcomes.

## Competency 4: Learning & Innovation

### Narrative Summary

In 2025, I advanced ACV's design organization by learning rapidly, experimenting intentionally, and creating systems that lifted how the entire team operates. My approach to innovation is grounded in practicality: understand the problem, test new methods, evaluate results, and scale what works. I focused on building capabilities that make our work faster, clearer, and more reliable, whether through AI acceleration, design system evolution, new workflow frameworks, or cross-team alignment tools.

One of the strongest examples is Project N.E.X.T., where I introduced ACV's first AI-assisted design to code workflow using Figma MCP and Claude Code. By benchmarking cycle time, handoff iterations, and preview generation, I transformed early AI experimentation into a structured operational strategy. Initial tests showed significant potential for reducing design to development cycle time, and I am now coordinating with engineering to validate this workflow on a new white-label component. This work positions ACV to ship faster in 2026 and beyond.

I also built innovation into organizational structure through the HOME alignment system, which automated cross-team visibility and set a new standard for how design communicates strategy, risks, and decisions. This system reduced churn, improved predictability, and provided leadership with consistent and transparent insight into customer-impacting work.

My innovation also extended to design systems. I led the Calculator component and mentored Emily on the Auction Card, tying DS thinking to clarity, scalability, and implementation quality. I documented principles, workflows, and naming standards that now guide how components evolve and integrate with engineering and AI workflows. This work not only improved product consistency but elevated DS maturity across the team.

On the product side, I applied learning and insight to innovate at scale. Appraisal Alerts introduced new batching patterns, lifecycle logic, and rule structures grounded in real dealer behavior. In NCP, I helped transform complex research insights into UX frameworks that support transparency, compliance, automation, and multi-store pricing operations. In both cases, I used research and domain learning to create solutions that dealers found highly adoptable and worth paying for.

Across tools, domains, and workflows, I treated learning as a multiplier. I experimented, documented, shared, and scaled. Everything I learned, whether AI approaches, enterprise pricing logic, DS systems, or cross-team alignment methods, became something the broader organization could use.
