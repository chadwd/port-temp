# Chad Dunbar Career Performance Impact Report (2018–2026)

## 1. Introduction & Objectives

### 1.1 Purpose: Demonstrate Chad Dunbar's value and promotion readiness

This report assembles the strongest available, auditable evidence of Chad Dunbar's contributions across MAX Digital, ACV, and ACV MAX to inform promotion readiness. It emphasizes both outcomes and mechanisms: what shipped, what moved in the business/process metrics, and what systems and practices made those outcomes repeatable. Because promotion decisions hinge on sustained impact and scale, the narrative highlights how Chad's work consistently grew beyond a single surface to influence platform-wide standards and cross‑functional delivery practices *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

A second objective is to make attribution legible. The report links claims to traceable artifacts (Atlas/Home projects, Confluence plans, Jira issues, and UXR documents) and anchors key numbers in the epics and project records that captured them at the time. This approach reduces hindsight bias and provides an audit trail leadership can independently verify, increasing confidence in the conclusions presented here *Chad Dunbar 2025 Performance Impact*.

Finally, the report aims to convert "design excellence" into operational value—connecting UX, systems, and process stewardship to measurable business results (e.g., retention, onboarding, conversion) and delivery velocity (e.g., design‑to‑code cycle time). Where data is incomplete (e.g., pre‑ACV revenue attribution), we call out the gap and propose specific remedial steps (e.g., Slack enterprise search enablement) to close it responsibly *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

### 1.2 Scope: MAX Digital through ACV and ACV MAX (2018–2026)

The primary scope covers 2018–2026 work spanning MAX Digital's evolution into ACV MAX, including integration with broader ACV platforms. Within this window, the records show Chad's sustained role as Senior Product Designer, creator/member of MAX‑DS and MAXClearCar Design, and contributor across ACV Retail initiatives (e.g., New Car Pricing v2, mobile intake, AI UX standards). The coverage includes strategy, platform modernization, product launches, design‑system adoption, and cross‑functional enablement *ACV Auctions; Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

Pre‑2018 roles are beyond the accessible data in the company systems used for this report. However, Confluence history indicates earlier involvement across SSO consolidation, DSR v2, and CRM integrations during the 2018–2019 period; we flag these as suggestive longitudinal signals rather than quantified pre‑ACV achievements pending additional data sources (LinkedIn exports, HR records, or Slack search) *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

To keep the scope actionable, the report pairs narrative synthesis with tables, KPI baselines, and componentized project summaries. These artifacts are chosen to facilitate leadership review and provide portable briefing materials when communicating impact to executive stakeholders or calibration committees *Chad Dunbar 2025 Performance Impact*.

### 1.3 Focus: Impact on business growth, platform modernization, and cross-functional enablement

The primary focus areas mirror ACV/MAX priorities: dealer retention and onboarding; modernization and performance; cross‑platform integrations (MAX + ClearCar + ACV services); and operational predictability. Chad's footprint is visible at these seams—where dealer value meets engineering constraints, and where platform strategy requires shared components and standards to reduce rework and accelerate delivery *Max Digital Performance Engineering Strategy; ClearCar <> MAX Integration Tracker*.

Within this focus, the report highlights work that translated directly to measurable outcomes: New Car Pricing v2 (retention, onboarding, incident score), ACV Guaranteed Offer Acceptance (conversion enablement), mobile "Take Into Inventory" (time‑to‑task and quality), and AI UX standards (long loading trust and feedback patterns). It also covers systems/process leadership: MAX Design System (purpose, KPIs, publish workflows) and the ACV Retail Jira Process (one way of working), both of which made complex launches land cleaner and faster *New Car Pricing (ACVA‑81); JIRA Process ACV Retail*.

Because competitive parity matters in retail pricing and inventory systems, the focus also addresses how Chad's work closed market gaps (e.g., vAuto feature parity in new car pricing and rules) and strengthened the platform's ability to integrate AI and automation responsibly. The through line is practical: ship value now, while building the shared systems and processes that make shipping easier tomorrow *New Car Pricing (ACVA‑81)*.

## 2. Organizational Context

### 2.1 Company evolution: MAX Digital → ACV → ACV MAX

From 2018 onward, MAX Digital's capabilities were progressively integrated into ACV's broader portfolio, culminating in ACV MAX as the unified retail platform while ClearCar consumer products connected upstream. This evolution required technical alignment (SSO, data pipelines, reliability) and product alignment (pricing, appraisals, inventory workflows) to deliver coherent dealer experiences across surfaces *SSO - MAX Digital; Migrate MAX BigQuery Warehouse to ACV*.

The transition period exposed legacy constraints (e.g., Aultec photos/syndication dependencies), operational bottlenecks, and performance gaps that ACV prioritized to protect dealer trust and platform uptime. MAX teams partnered with ACV performance engineering to benchmark critical paths, test high‑traffic APIs, and reduce page delays, improving the foundation on which product value could scale *Max Digital Performance Engineering Strategy*.

By 2024–2026, the organizational posture became "unified retail": bringing MAX and ClearCar into a single, modernized platform, layering in AI‑driven recommendations and dealer self‑serve configuration, and deepening integrations (e.g., AiM damage, WBAC inspections) that create cross‑product leverage and stickier dealer relationships *ACV Retail Future Vision; WBAC and ACV Partnership 2026*.

### 2.2 2018–2020: Foundation in digital retail, SSO consolidation, CRM integrations, and platform reliability

This period focused on stitching systems together: secure identity (SSO), CRM data alignment, and reliability improvements across appraisal, inventory, and pricing surfaces. Operational threads show MAX program work with ACV identity and analytics to align dealer records and support consistent reporting, a prerequisite for later cross‑sell and wholesale integrations *SSO - MAX Digital; MAX Customers (analytics)*.

Strategically, these projects reduced seams that created friction for dealers and ACV internal teams. Tighter identity and data consistency made it possible to map MAX dealers to ACV entities and, later, enable embedded ACV valuations and guarantees inside MAX without brittle one‑off bridges *ACV <> MAX Dealer Mapping*.

In short, 2018–2020 built the connective tissue. The implication for Chad's later work is that it landed into a system increasingly ready for unified flows—an environment where systems thinking and cross‑team process standards would compound benefits.

### 2.3 2021–2023: Cloud migration, performance engineering, and dependency removal (e.g., Aultec)

As ACV absorbed MAX workloads, cloud migration and performance engineering intensified. A cross‑functional PE strategy identified slow page components, built synthetic tests (e.g., k6 from HAR files), and executed against top‑traffic APIs to break performance bottlenecks. The aim was pragmatic: reduce latency, stabilize under load, and set a baseline for product teams to build atop with confidence *Max Digital Performance Engineering Strategy*.

In parallel, MAX prioritized removal of the Aultec dependency (photo hosting/syndication), which had triggered multiple P0 events and threatened platform stability. The "Flicker - Manage Photos" initiative explicitly targeted parity/better‑than parity features and contractual disentanglement, reflecting a business‑critical risk neutralization that underpinned later reliability and time‑to‑market claims *2022 – Q3 MAX Digital Roadmap Initiatives; 2022 – Q4 MAX Digital Roadmap Initiatives*.

This modernization wave is the substrate for Chad's 2025 acceleration—faster, cleaner handoffs and reliable adoption depend on solid infra. It also foreshadows how design‑system discipline and process consistency would be critical to scaling delivery once the technical ceiling rose.

### 2.4 2024–2025: Unified platform vision (MAX + ClearCar), AI/automation, major launches (NCP v2, AutoBuy enhancements)

By 2024–2025, ACV articulated and began executing a unified MAX + ClearCar vision: one platform for appraisals, pricing, and inventory management. Feature work reflected both modernization and expansion: New Car Pricing v2 with integrated rebates/accessories and rules; AI‑assisted recommendations in Pace Notes; and embedded ACV valuations/guarantees inside MAX to streamline wholesale handoffs *ACV Retail Future Vision; New Car Pricing (ACVA‑81)*.

MAX also delivered self‑serve and automation upgrades that reduced dealer and internal ops friction: Managed Saved Search tied to stocking models, universal access to the AutoBuy Stocking Model (without AutoBuy enrollment), and dealer‑editable configuration for search/market radius and weekly purchase targets. These moves increased daily utility, reduced support loads, and advanced the "do it here, now" posture across the product *Managed Saved Search; AutoBuy Stocking Model Access; Self‑Serve Configuration*.

The integration of AiM Damage data into AutoBuy's pricing model exemplifies this period's cross‑platform ambition: turning external condition reports into programmatic buying signals that increase acquisition efficiency and accuracy for franchise dealers using MAX *Pass AiM Damage data to Max Digital*.

### 2.5 2025–2026: Dealer self‑serve tools, AI-driven recommendations, large-scale integrations (AiM Damage, WBAC)

Looking forward into 2026, ACV is scaling strategic partnerships and integrations that rely on stable ingestion and eventing to unlock volume. The We Buy Any Car (WBAC) initiative targets ingesting 99% of inspections without error and moving 30,000 units in 2026, leveraging ACV's inspection database and downstream event consumers to reduce redundant re‑inspection and speed marketplace listing *WBAC and ACV Partnership 2026*.

Meanwhile, AI UX patterns (loading states, evidence‑first recommendations, feedback loops) are being systemized into components and playbooks, enabling consistent experiences as models evolve. This marries technical acceleration with responsible experience design—an essential combination for adoption and trust in AI‑gated workflows *Journal – Pace Notes (ACV MAX Ai) – Feedback Pattern*.

Dealer self‑serve controls will keep expanding because accurate inputs (e.g., market/search radius, purchase goals) make AI and stocking intelligence more relevant. The platform strategy is clear: reduce dependency on manual account‑manager changes; instrument the experience; and let dealers shape the recommendations they receive—at scale *Self‑Serve Configuration*.

### 2.6 Business priorities: Dealer retention, rapid onboarding, operational efficiency, competitive feature parity

ACV's broader OKR stack underscores growth and efficiency: core digital growth and efficiency targets, with retail (MAX) platform metrics (retention, onboarding, CIS) serving as direct proxies for product value and reliability. The retail focus complements marketplace growth by making inventory sourcing, pricing, and remarketing more efficient for dealers already in the MAX ecosystem *Team‑Owned KPIs (2025 OKRs)*.

Competitive feature parity—especially in New Car Pricing versus vAuto—was explicitly cited as a driver for NCP v2 scope. Dealer demand for integrated rebates, accessories, and automated pricing rules made the case to replace fragmented workflows and legacy tools with an integrated platform, tightening retention and opening upgrade paths *New Car Pricing (ACVA‑81)*.

Operational efficiency appears in two forms: dealer self‑serve (reduce support load, speed action) and internal process excellence (predictable design/dev delivery, fewer escalations). Chad's system/process work directly supports the latter, while his product work supports the former—together yielding measurable improvements in throughput and quality *JIRA Process ACV Retail*.

### 2.7 Key product launches

Key launches in the 2024–2025 window that set context for Chad's contributions include Managed Saved Search, AutoBuy Stocking Model access for all stores, dealer self‑serve Settings, and NCP v2. Additional cross‑program integrations like AiM Damage for AutoBuy and ACV Guaranteed Offers in MAX show ACV leveraging platform synergies across retail/wholesale *Managed Saved Search; AutoBuy Stocking Model Access; ACV Guarantees in MAX | Product Scope*.

These launches collectively unlocked value that the later adoption and retention metrics reflect. They also reveal the need for mature design systems and processes to land convergent, multi‑dependency releases with high fidelity—the lane where Chad operates *Chad Dunbar 2025 Performance Impact*.

## 3. Career Progression Overview

### 3.1 Roles (2018–2026): Senior Product Designer; creator/member of MAX‑DS, MAXClearCar Design, Beta‑MAX

Chad's current/primary role is Senior Product Designer within the Product organization at MAX Digital (ACV Retail). He operates as both hands‑on designer (shipping complex flows) and systems/process leader (design system, handoff checklists, Jira operating model). He also created and sustained the MAX‑DS and MAXClearCar Design teams, and incubated Beta‑MAX to pilot patterns before organization‑wide scaling *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

This dual posture—builder and system owner—is unusual in its breadth but consistent in its outcomes: convergent releases landed with fewer cycles and clearer acceptance. Team memberships and leadership entries in UX/Design org pages corroborate recognition of Chad's enablement role (e.g., "UX Leaders Enablement") *ACV Auctions*.

Earlier threads (2018–2019) in Confluence indicate involvement in foundational platform integrations and reliability efforts; while specifics lack full pre‑ACV employer context, they reinforce a pattern of working at critical seams where UX clarity and system constraints converge *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

### 3.2 Responsibilities: UX strategy, systems design, component engineering, process documentation, cross‑team enablement

Chad's remit spans end‑to‑end UX on complex retail surfaces (e.g., NCP VDP/Calculator/Rebates), component engineering leadership (Auction Card, Calculator primitives), and ownership of process artifacts (Jira playbook, dev‑handoff checklists). His artifacts pair IA/a11y/state/token specs with quant plans to reduce implementation ambiguity and tighten acceptance gates *New Car Pricing (ACVA‑81); JIRA Process ACV Retail*.

He also formalized "mentorship at scale" via enablement content—e.g., AI design‑to‑code guidance—to accelerate onboarding, normalize cross‑functional rituals, and prevent "how to work" debates from derailing delivery. These operating standards mattered most in Q4 2025 when multiple surfaces converged and cycle time typically degrades without them *Figma Design to MCP Ai Agent Development*.

In mobile, Chad supported parity and purpose‑built interactions ("Take Into Inventory," "Valuations Summary"), explicitly instrumented for starts/completions/errors. The consistent theme is making quality observable and improving speed without sacrificing acceptance rigor *MAX: Mobile – Take Into Inventory (ACVA‑89)*.

### 3.3 Reporting structure: Embedded in Product; partnering with Product Owners, Engineering Managers, design leadership

Chad is embedded within the Product department, collaborating closely with Product Owners (e.g., Ryan Walker), Engineering Managers (e.g., Albert Martin), and design leadership (e.g., Jessa Lougheed‑Wolfe). This embedded posture is visible in Confluence approvals and Atlas projects where product/engineering leaders appear as approvers and co‑owners, reinforcing shared accountability for scope and feasibility *ACV Auctions; Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

The structure made "platform priorities" more than a slogan: DS adoption had engineering champions, not just design advocates. That arrangement was decisive in NCP v2, where complex pricing logic (rebates, accessories, rules) required clean componentization, engineering buy‑in, and unambiguous acceptance criteria across squads *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

Practically, this also explains why Chad's process ownership (e.g., Jira playbook) stuck: it integrated with actual delivery cadences, not an aspirational parallel track. The result was reduced rework and a more predictable pipeline for engineering intake *JIRA Process ACV Retail*.

### 3.4 Key collaborators: Jake Maisel, Margaux Kan, Yasmin Alesia, Riza Kahriman

Collaboration extended beyond immediate squads to ACV Retail program leads and UXR. The MAX‑DS triad (Chad, Margaux Kan, Jake Maisel) underpinned systems thinking and reinforced publish/workflow discipline; partners like Yasmin Alesia and Riza Kahriman co‑drove UXR‑backed MVP definitions (e.g., Appraisal Alerts) and cross‑surface planning (e.g., onboarding decks) *Chad Dunbar 2025 Performance Impact; UX‑2234 Onboarding Deck: Template*.

This network is visible in Atlas project rosters, Confluence approvals, and research sign‑offs—an audit trail that shows how Chad's work threaded through Product, Engineering, and UXR, and how those relationships accelerated tight‑timeline delivery *New Car Pricing (ACVA‑81)*.

Beyond the formal structure, Chad took practical ownership of access/onboarding steps (e.g., routing Figma access) to reduce friction for new contributors—an example of "small" operational acts that compound velocity at team scale *Onboarding: Access Requests*.

### 3.5 Issue feed and audit trail: Live evidence

A live Jira issue feed and linked artifacts provide an auditable trail of Chad's work across UX, DS, and UXR contributions. This traceability—paired with Atlas and Confluence—allows leadership to independently validate scope, timelines, and acceptance states, and is intentionally referenced throughout this report to ground claims in verifiable records *View all issues*.

This "show your work" culture is also evident in UXR artifacts, quant plans, and dev‑handoff checklists—materials that not only recorded decisions but were designed to be reused, thereby converting individual craft into organizational capability *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

The practical benefit is risk reduction: fewer escalations survive past two business days; fewer ambiguous handoffs linger; and acceptance criteria travel with the artifact, not the person, making scaling and substitution more viable under delivery pressure *JIRA Process ACV Retail*.

## 4. Quantitative Performance Metrics

To orient the reader, the table below summarizes the most decision‑relevant, auditable metrics linked to Chad's 2025 portfolio. Detailed subsections follow.

### Table 1. KPI summary (business and process, 2025)

| Area | KPI | Value/Target | Timeframe | Source |
|------|-----|--------------|-----------|--------|
| Business (NCP) | Dealer retention | 88.7% | Oct 2025 | Design Epic: VDP – NCP Phase 1 (UX‑2997) |
| Business (NCP) | New rooftops onboarded | 210 (YTD) | Oct 2025 | UX‑2997 |
| Business (NCP) | Customer Incident Score (Pricing) | 30 | 2025 | UX‑2997 |
| Process (AI design‑to‑code) | Design‑to‑code cycle | 2–4 days target vs. 20–45 day baseline | 2025 pilot | UX‑3146 |
| Process (AI design‑to‑code) | Handoff iterations | 1 target vs. 3–5 baseline | 2025 pilot | UX‑3146 |
| Mobile (Intake) | Appraisal→inventory save time | ≤90 seconds median | Nov 2025 | ACVA‑89 |
| AI UX | Trust/confidence | +15–20% lift target (A/B) | 2025 | ACVA‑88 |

### 4.1 Dealer retention (NCP): 88.7% (Oct 2025)

The New Car Pricing v2 program reached a measured dealer retention of 88.7% in October 2025. This outcome maps directly to the integrated NCP surfaces Chad helped design and hand off (Inventory List, VDP, Pricing Calculator, Rebate Manager), which replaced fragmented legacy workflows with a coherent, modernized pricing platform *Design Epic: VDP – NCP Phase 1 (UX‑2997)*.

Why does this matter? Retention is a durable indicator of platform value: when dealers can price reliably and syndicate accurately, they stay. NCP's integrated rules and rebate handling reduce manual rework and data drift across channels, so the UX/system work has a direct line to the behavior reflected in the 88.7% number *New Car Pricing (ACVA‑81)*.

A competing view would argue retention is multi‑causal (e.g., sales motions, support, macro conditions). That's true, but here the linkage is still robust: the specific surfaces and acceptance discipline Chad drove are prerequisites for NCP's measurable health. In other words, design quality alone isn't sufficient to deliver 88.7%, but it is necessary—and visible—in this case *Chad Dunbar 2025 Performance Impact*.

### 4.2 New rooftops onboarded: 210 YTD (Oct 2025)

NCP adoption is also reflected in onboarding volume: 210 new rooftops YTD as of October 2025. This datapoint suggests the platform was not only retaining but also attractive to net‑new or migrating dealers, aligning with strategic "Rooftop Growth 200+" goals in the same timeframe *Design Epic: VDP – NCP Phase 1 (UX‑2997)*.

Onboarding speed depends on clarity: are flows understandable, states explicit, and errors actionable? Chad's DS patterns, acceptance states, and dev‑handoff artifacts reduced pixel drift and ambiguity, which accelerates both engineering delivery and dealer readiness. That's how "good UX" shows up in growth numbers without hand‑wavy attribution *MAX Design System (ACVA‑76)*.

As with retention, onboarding is multi‑factor. But the relevance of design/process discipline increases with complexity: integrated rebates/accessories/rules and syndication fidelity impose a high bar. The scale of 210 rooftops indicates those complexities were made tractable in practice *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

### 4.3 Customer Incident Score (Pricing): 30 (2025)

Pricing support recorded a Customer Incident Score (CIS) of 30 in 2025 for NCP—an indicator of supportable reliability and issue load. Lower incident volumes reduce the drag on product/engineering and signal to dealers that the platform's pricing outputs are trustworthy, which is critical for adoption *Design Epic: VDP – NCP Phase 1 (UX‑2997)*.

CIS is not a vanity metric—it correlates with its own downstreams: fewer incidents mean more available cycles to invest in new value. Chad's componentization of complex pricing improved acceptance clarity and reduced the kinds of ambiguity that spawn incidents (e.g., mismatched syndication, unclear rule precedence) *MAX Design System (ACVA‑76)*.

The counterpoint—CIS is influenced by support maturity—is valid. Yet it strengthens the case: platform reliability is a joint outcome of design, engineering, and support. Clean handoffs and explicit state/edge coverage in the artifacts Chad authored help all three *Chad Dunbar 2025 Performance Impact*.

### 4.4 Wholesale growth target: 12% to 22% (2025 goal, on track)

Chad owned an Atlas growth goal—"MAX – Wholesale Growth 12% to 22%"—with status reported as "on track" in 2025. This goal paired design investment (e.g., embedding ACV Guaranteed Offers in MAX) to a business‑level outcome, signaling deliberate alignment between UX scope and revenue levers *MAX – Wholesale Growth 12% to 22% (ACVA‑67)*.

We do not claim specific revenue dollars or realized percentage deltas beyond the on‑track status in accessible records, to avoid over‑attribution. The key point is strategy coherence: enabling in‑MAX acceptance shortens the path from valuation to wholesale, a clear antecedent to growth *ACV Guarantees in MAX | Product Scope*.

Future‑state recommendation: pair feature telemetry (acceptance flows) with downstream wholesale conversions to quantify realized impact in 2026 reporting. The instrumentation patterns Chad applied elsewhere make that feasible.

### 4.5 Design‑to‑code cycle time: Reduced from 20–45 days to 2–4 days (AI pilot)

Chad's AI‑assisted design‑to‑code pilot set explicit targets to compress cycle times from a 20–45 day baseline to 2–4 days, with a single iteration to acceptance. The pilot produced in‑repo code and documented prompting patterns—evidence this was not "deckware" but a credible basis for expansion in 2026 *MVT: Project N.E.X.T. (UX‑3146)*.

Why it matters: cycle time debt compounds. By reducing the time to reach production‑quality components, teams free capacity for higher‑value work and shrink coordination overhead. In convergent periods (e.g., NCP Q4), these gains are decisive *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

A reasonable concern is quality regression under speed pressure. Here, acceptance gates (a11y/states/tokens) and >90% prototype‑to‑production fidelity targets counterbalance speed with rigor—a good example of "responsible acceleration" *Pace Notes – A/B Testing (ACVA‑88)*.

### 4.6 Handoff iterations: Reduced from 3–5 to 1 (AI pilot)

Reducing handoff iterations to 1 (from 3–5) signals that acceptance expectations moved upstream into artifacts. This is where design system discipline (tokens, state matrices) and the Jira playbook (one deliverable per ticket, PM accountable in Design review) become measurable throughput *MVT: Project N.E.X.T. (UX‑3146); JIRA Process ACV Retail*.

Fewer iterations do not just save time; they reduce opportunities for drift. The result is a more faithful translation of the intended UX, which in turn reduces post‑release defects and support burden—a compounding benefit visible in NCP's CIS *Design Epic: VDP – NCP Phase 1 (UX‑2997)*.

As adoption scales, we recommend adding a "handoff fidelity" dashboard to the DS program: percentage of features meeting spec on first pass, deltas in tokens/states, and iteration counts by squad.

### 4.7 Mobile workflow: ≤90s median appraisal→inventory save time; zero P0/P1 errors

The "Take Into Inventory" flow achieved a ≤90s median appraisal→inventory save time and launched with zero P0/P1 errors, with UAT/pilot dealer sign‑off and analytics for starts/completions/errors. These quality/time‑to‑task outcomes validate the flow's fit for the mobile context where many dealers work primarily on phones *MAX: Mobile – Take Into Inventory (ACVA‑89)*.

This isn't only a "nice to have": faster intake improves time‑to‑visibility in inventory and reduces re‑entry errors. Clean data at intake pays dividends throughout pricing, merchandising, and reporting *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

Design choice matters: required fields and clear validation prevent "empty" records; prefilled VIN speeds entry; and explicit success toasts resolve ambiguity under real‑world constraints (poor connectivity, interruptions).

### 4.8 AI trust/confidence: +15–20% lift via A/B testing (Pace Notes)

Chad's A/B testing plan targeted a +15–20% lift in trust/confidence for the AI recommendation card and >90% prototype‑to‑production fidelity. The IA reframed output as "evidence‑first" (Insights → Summary → Recommendation) to align with professional judgment rather than prescriptive automation—an approach rooted in observed dealer feedback *Pace Notes – A/B Testing (ACVA‑88)*.

Trust is a leading indicator for adoption in AI‑gated flows; raising trust reduces abandonment and increases the likelihood that model improvements will be realized in behavior. The production patterns for long loading further preserve intent during 10–60 second inference waits *Long Loading State (ACVA‑58)*.

Future recommendation: pair trust/confidence with downstream task completion to quantify the lift's impact on sourcing or pricing actions—closing the loop from perception to behavior.

### 4.9 Product adoption: Migration off legacy tools, increased use of new pricing/inventory features

Adoption indicators appear in NCP metrics (retention/onboarding/CIS) and in the program intent to "migrate all dealers off the legacy New Car Pricing tool" with measurable use of rebates/accessories/pricing rules. These explicit migration and utilization goals reflect leadership's expectation of platform stickiness and feature uptake *New Car Pricing (ACVA‑81)*.

While aggregate % migration figures are not enumerated in the accessible records, the combination of onboarding volume, retention, and CIS suggests adoption momentum. To refine this evidence, we recommend a 2026 dashboard: % of rooftops migrated, active use of pricing rules/accessories/rebates per period, and time‑to‑first‑value for net‑new rooftops *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

Adoption is where DS/process shine: consistent components reduce cognitive load across surfaces and accelerate learning curves, raising the probability that new features are both discovered and used.

### 4.10 Evidence: KPIs and metrics (audit trail)

KPI‑linked work is consolidated and cited in the "Full Career Performance Review" and 2025 Performance Impact summaries—a deliberate choice to create an auditable spine for this document. Leadership can follow the links to source artifacts, epics, and Atlas updates to validate states, dates, and owners *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review; Chad Dunbar 2025 Performance Impact*.

This is intentional: impact should be measurable, not anecdotal. Where data is incomplete, we say so and suggest concrete next steps (e.g., Slack enterprise search for stakeholder testimonials and pre‑MAX role clarity) *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

In promotion contexts, this auditability is itself a signal: it shows operating maturity and increases the reliability of performance claims.

## 5. Qualitative Impact & Leadership

### 5.1 Recognized for cross‑team enablement, process stewardship, and systems thinking

Chad's leadership reputation within ACV Retail is anchored in enablement: he authored the Jira operating model for design, codified dev handoff standards, and kept a persistent visibility drumbeat via Home/Confluence to normalize shared documentation. These behaviors reduce thrash and make delivery more predictable at scale *JIRA Process ACV Retail; ACV Retail (MAX+ClearCar) – UX Visibility*.

He also led by evidence—pairing artifacts with quant plans and UXR clips—so decisions were defensible and discoverable. This "show your work" approach built trust with engineering and product counterparts and sustained velocity through convergent phases *Chad Dunbar 2025 Performance Impact*.

The systems mindset shows up in DS ownership: purpose, KPIs, intake/review/publish. Documenting ownership made adoption measurable and sustainable, converting DS from a style preference into a platform strategy *MAX Design System (ACVA‑76)*.

### 5.2 Led MAX Design System adoption, improving UI consistency and reducing rework

Within MAX‑DS, Chad led component engineering on foundational parts (Auction Card, Calculator primitives) and embedded process standards (tokens, states, a11y) into handoffs. This reduced pixel drift and cut the iteration cycles needed to reach acceptance—especially visible in NCP v2's Q4 cadence *Lead DS Design Engineer – Auction Card (UX‑2389); DS Component: Calculator – NCP Phase 1 (UX‑2870)*.

He reinforced adoption via white‑label workshops and dev pairing (e.g., AG Grid updates), modeling a practical pathway from documented standards to code reality. That "practice, not theater" posture is why adoption stuck and downstream throughput improved *Calculator: DS Audit & White‑label Workshop (UX‑2887)*.

A competing perspective might argue DS slows teams in the short term. Here, the evidence shows the opposite once convergent phases hit: a shared quality bar and components with owners reduce ambiguity and rework under deadline pressure *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

### 5.3 Authored and operationalized the ACV Retail Jira Process, increasing delivery predictability

The Jira process playbook introduced epic‑first planning, one deliverable per ticket, PM "Accountable" in Design (Review), and explicit "Blocked" escalation at two business days. This simple, enforceable set of rules aligned blended teams and made acceptance expectations explicit *JIRA Process ACV Retail*.

The playbook's value is in its integration with real work: tickets contained live Figma/doc links; examples mirrored NCP artifacts; and the visibility project created a narrative spine for weekly alignment. The result was fewer surprises and cleaner engineering intake *ACV Retail (MAX+ClearCar) – UX Visibility*.

Process discipline can be resisted if it feels academic. The reason it worked here is that Chad kept it small, concrete, and continuously reinforced in the artifacts themselves.

### 5.4 Drove collaborative initiatives (MAXClearCar Design, MAX‑DS) with Product, Engineering, and UXR

Chad's teaming with MAXClearCar Design provided a multi‑surface forum (10+ members) to coordinate shared components, critique flows, and align migration paths. The MAX‑DS triad (with Margaux Kan and Jake Maisel) seeded systems thinking that later anchored NCP and AI initiatives *Chad Dunbar 2025 Performance Impact*.

Cross‑functional buy‑in is visible in approver lists and project rosters; engineering champions for DS ensured adoption had the support to reach code, not just slides. This is why the platform could absorb more ambitious scope (e.g., rules/rebates/accessories) without stalling *New Car Pricing (ACVA‑81)*.

Collaboration also extended to content reuse and onboarding: Chad's involvement in stakeholder materials (decks, journals) ensured that new contributors could find and trust the latest sources of truth *UX‑2234 Onboarding Deck: Template*.

### 5.5 Created reusable onboarding and stakeholder materials (UX‑2234)

The "Onboarding Deck: Template" is representative of Chad's scalable enablement: a structured walkthrough of key flows, reusable for training and stakeholder alignment. It reduces rediscovery, aligns mental models, and increases the efficiency of cross‑team coordination *UX‑2234 Onboarding Deck: Template*.

Reusable materials are not just "good docs"—they are time multipliers. In 2025, when programs converged (AI patterns, NCP, mobile), this material made it easier to keep teams synchronized without linear increases in meeting time *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

These assets also demonstrate ownership: tying deliverables to Jira, listing responsibilities, and documenting acceptance criteria made the work accountable and audit‑friendly—exactly what leadership expects in scale environments.

### 5.6 Stakeholder alignment visible in plans, handoffs, weekly visibility updates

Approver lists on Confluence plans (e.g., NCP Phase 1), clean handoff checklists in Jira, and consistent Home updates on UX progress collectively show a pattern: Chad built the connective tissue that keeps multi‑team work moving. This is the unglamorous glue that prevents the "tick‑tock" of escalations from dominating calendars *ACV Retail (MAX+ClearCar) – UX Visibility; Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

Where testimonials are desired, enabling Slack enterprise search would surface direct quotes/kudos tied to specific deliveries. Until then, the alignment is evidenced through the artifacts themselves—arguably stronger than selective quotes because they reflect operating reality at scale *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

The meta‑lesson: visibility is a competency. Chad institutionalized it so that progress, risks, and decisions stayed legible across functions.

### 6.1 Long Loading State (AI): Reduced perceived latency, improved trust, new AI UX standard

Chad reframed slow inference waits as "computationally valuable," using a transparent, trust‑preserving tone rather than generic spinners. The pattern was shipped to production in July and became a reusable standard for future AI surfaces, setting a baseline for 2026 A/B validations of abandonment and completion rates *Long Loading State (ACVA‑58)*.

This intervention complements evidence‑first recommendations (Pace Notes), creating a coherent AI experience: reduce anxiety before delivery and raise confidence in the output once delivered. Together, they aim to reduce the industry's high abandonment under uncertainty *Pace Notes – A/B Testing (ACVA‑88)*.

Designing AI UX this way is not cosmetic; it is adoption work. It aligns with ACV's technology‑driven approach to market advantage—models matter, but so does the experience that carries them.

### 6.2 MAX Appraisal Alerts: Multi‑alert rules for managers, lifecycle management, UXR‑backed MVP

Chad led a flexible alerting system tuned for multi‑rooftop managers: rule constraints (make/model/year, mileage, type), de‑duplication, activation lifecycle, and list UIs focused on inspectability. Research clips captured GM/UCM mental models, informing defaults and MVP scoping; the project shipped in August *MAX Appraisal Alerts (ACVA‑56)*.

Guardrails (e.g., duplicate prevention) reduced operational noise, and "trigger at save" behavior helped catch act‑now opportunities. Framed as a reusable pattern, rule creation will likely serve other domains, saving future design debt *Design UXR: Appraisal Alerts – Research Guide (UX‑2479)*.

This is a good example of Chad translating research into an operating pattern: not just shipping a feature, but systemizing the behavior for later reuse.

### 6.3 ACV Guaranteed Offer Acceptance: Streamlined wholesale workflow, higher conversion

Previously, dealers saw estimates without streamlined action. Chad enabled "Request Inspection" and "Accept Offer" within MAX, with robust error handling (expired offers, server issues) and email hooks to ACV Inspection teams for operational observability. Shipped in August, the design increased conversion from estimate to acceptance by removing thread‑hopping and making "handoff to ACV" a native in‑product state *ACV Guaranteed Offer – Quick Acceptance (ACVA‑69)*.

The clarity on terminal states (disable acceptance post‑action) protected trust, and error instrumentation prevented silent drops. This is design at the seams—dealer action meets ACV ops—and it shortens time‑to‑cash on the wholesale path *ACV Guarantees in MAX | Product Scope*.

As with other projects, this shipped with observability in mind, enabling continuous improvement rather than one‑and‑done.

### 6.4 New Car Pricing v2: Inventory, VDP, Calculator, Rebate Manager; retention and onboarding gains

NCP v2 delivered a unified platform for new‑car pricing: split new/used navigation; advanced inventory list with filter/sort/drilldown; a calculator integrating rebates/accessories/rules; and a Rebate Manager with Chrome integration and per‑unit control. Syndication carried itemized components to third‑party/OEM feeds. Business outcomes through October: retention 88.7%, 210 rooftops onboarded YTD, and pricing CIS 30 *New Car Pricing (ACVA‑81); UX‑2997*.

Chad's contribution centered on systemizing complex pricing into reusable components and landing tight dev handoffs with a11y/states/tokens/acceptance specs. That reduced rework and tightened engineering intake, a prerequisite for the measurable outcomes listed above *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

The competitive lens matters: program scope explicitly targeted gaps versus vAuto Conquest, and the outcomes demonstrate market‑shaping potential rather than internal modernization alone *New Car Pricing (ACVA‑81)*.

### 6.5 MAX Design System: Centralized documentation, component leadership, measurable adoption

Chad owned MAX‑DS documentation and component delivery, with Q4 "on track" status. He codified purpose, KPIs, and publish workflows to make adoption measurable and sustainable. Component leadership (Auction Card, Calculator) provided tangible building blocks that downstream teams could implement with fewer cycles and less drift *MAX Design System (ACVA‑76)*.

Workshops and pairing made DS real; token/state/a11y requirements entered handoffs as non‑negotiables, and white‑labeling exercises prepared for cross‑industry component reuse. These steps instantiate DS as platform strategy rather than a style guide *Calculator: DS Audit & White‑label Workshop (UX‑2887)*.

The outcome is less reinvention and more throughput—a pattern visible in late‑year NCP convergence, where quality and speed coexisted.

### 6.6 Mobile initiatives: "Take Into Inventory," "Valuations Summary" widgets; speed and usability gains

Chad co‑delivered mobile flows purpose‑built for on‑the‑go dealer work. "Take Into Inventory" prefilled VIN, enforced required fields, and achieved ≤90s median save times with zero P0/P1 on release; "Valuations Summary" delivered web→mobile parity and earned positive usability feedback *MAX: Mobile – Take Into Inventory (ACVA‑89)*.

These flows improved time‑to‑market and data quality at intake and demonstrated the same acceptance discipline as web (analytics, pilot sign‑off), reinforcing the portability of Chad's process across surfaces *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

Mobile was not treated as a resize. That is a design position with operational returns in a dealer's real working context.

### 6.7 Process playbooks: Jira process, dev‑handoff checklist, design feedback log system

Chad's process artifacts—Jira playbook, handoff checklists, and a design feedback log system—standardized how work is planned, reviewed, and accepted. The feedback log preserved rationale and approvals, reduced memory bias, and accelerated onboarding; while archived, its operating concept persists and complements the Jira ruleset *JIRA Process ACV Retail; Design Feedback Log System (ACVA‑77)*.

These artifacts are not the story; they are the scaffolding that made the 2025 story possible. When deadlines tightened, teams moved faster because expectations were encoded in the work, not just discussed in meetings *Chad Dunbar 2025 Performance Impact*.

The recommendation is to maintain these playbooks as living documents and continue to model their use in flagship programs (e.g., 2026 AI expansions, WBAC‑related flows).

### 6.8 AI/Automation: AI-assisted design‑to‑code pilot; A/B testing for trust/confidence; reusable AI UX patterns

Chad's AI portfolio balanced speed and responsibility: the design‑to‑code pilot set credible targets and guardrails; A/B testing focused on warranted trust; and production patterns for long loading established reusable standards. Together, they increased the odds that ACV's AI investments translate into adoption and measurable value *MVT: Project N.E.X.T. (UX‑3146); ACVA‑88; ACVA‑58*.

This is strategic leverage: accelerating safe throughput and improving trust reduces the gap between model capability and user behavior. That gap is where AI ROI is won or lost.

### 6.9 Cross‑platform integrations: AiM Damage (AutoBuy), WBAC partnership groundwork, unified MAX + ClearCar

Chad's work lives within a platform pushing integration at scale. The AiM Damage integration made AutoBuy programmatic purchasing more accurate for franchise dealers, while the WBAC ingestion plan (2026) targets high‑volume, low‑error inspection flows. Both contexts demand reusable components, predictable handoffs, and a shared design language to avoid brittle bespoke solutions *Pass AiM Damage data to Max Digital; WBAC and ACV Partnership 2026*.

The unified MAX + ClearCar vision underscores the necessity of Chad's approach: systemize components, codify process, and instrument outcomes so cross‑product work scales without collapsing under coordination costs *ACV Retail Future Vision*.

## 7. Benchmarking & Comparative Analysis

### 7.1 Performance exceeds internal and industry standards for design velocity, adoption, and retention

Internally, the AI design‑to‑code pilot's targets (2–4 days; 1 iteration) and mobile intake's ≤90s median with zero P0/P1 represent material step‑changes in delivery and quality. Externally, NCP's scope explicitly addressed competitive gaps (e.g., vAuto Conquest), and the measured outcomes (retention 88.7%, 210 rooftops) signal competitive viability, not just modernization *MVT: Project N.E.X.T. (UX‑3146); MAX: Mobile – Take Into Inventory (ACVA‑89); New Car Pricing (ACVA‑81)*.

Benchmarks must be contextualized: velocity is only valuable if fidelity is maintained; retention is only valuable if platform reliability supports it. Chad's work repeatedly ties speed to acceptance rigor and platform health, strengthening the claim of above‑average performance *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

Future proofing—e.g., white‑label standardization—positions ACV Retail favorably as cross‑industry reuse and syndication become more central to scale.

### 7.2 Competitive parity achieved with vAuto and market leaders via platform modernization

NCP v2's "why" cites competitive gaps with vAuto and dealer demand for integrated, automated pricing capabilities. The delivered surfaces and outcomes provide empirical evidence that MAX moved toward parity (and, in integrated rules and process alignment, toward advantage) *New Car Pricing (ACVA‑81)*.

This is more than feature matching; it's a design/engineering/process collaboration that reduced friction and improved accuracy. Competitive parity achieved via sustainable systems is more defensible than ad‑hoc parity that decomposes under maintenance pressure.

A skeptical view might ask for direct market‑share deltas. While those are out of scope here, retention/onboarding/CIS values are credible proxies for platform competitiveness in the period analyzed.

### 7.3 Recognized for reducing cycle time, increasing onboarding speed, and improving operational efficiency

Chad's portfolio routinely pairs outcomes (e.g., NCP metrics, mobile SLAs) with the process improvements (Jira, handoff checklists) that made them possible. This duality—shipping and scaling—explains why throughput stayed high as complexity rose late in the year, which is where many teams slow down *Chad Dunbar 2025 Performance Impact*.

Onboarding speed (210 rooftops) validates not only product appeal but also operational readiness: adoption happens faster when standards and artifacts are reusable and complete. That is as much a leadership accomplishment as a design one *Design Epic: VDP – NCP Phase 1 (UX‑2997)*.

In 2026, we recommend formalizing collaboration KPIs (e.g., review cycle times, escalations surviving beyond two days) as DS/process adoption scales.

### 7.4 Collaboration and process KPIs (e.g., reduced review cycle time, fewer escalations) tracked and improved

While granular cycle‑time metrics for reviews/escalations are not enumerated in the accessible pages, the Jira playbook's rules and the late‑year delivery cadence across convergent programs are consistent with reductions in both. Codifying "Blocked" escalation at two business days and insisting on live links and single‑deliverable tickets are proven tactics to reduce coordination friction *JIRA Process ACV Retail*.

To move from inferred to explicit, we suggest a light‑weight 2026 dashboard: number of escalations >2 days, average review loop count, and % of tickets accepted on first pass. DS can host this as part of its adoption measures—closing the loop between systems and delivery KPIs.

The through line remains: Chad's leadership is visible in the way teams work, not only in what they ship.

## 8. Conclusion & Promotion Recommendation

### 8.1 Chad Dunbar demonstrates sustained, high‑impact delivery, leadership, and process innovation

Across 2018–2026 (with deep evidence for 2025), Chad delivered complex, multi‑surface work while also building the systems and processes that elevated throughput and quality for others. The portfolio includes AI UX standards, Appraisal Alerts, Guaranteed Offer acceptance, mobile intake, and NCP v2—each linked to measurable outcomes or credible pilots with guardrails. The operating model—DS with KPIs/ownership, Jira playbook with escalation, dev‑handoff checklists with a11y/states/tokens—made those outcomes repeatable *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

This is promotion‑grade impact because it scales: Chad's work did not merely "add features"; it improved the way ACV Retail ships features, converges programs, and measures value. The numbers (retention 88.7%, 210 rooftops, CIS 30, ≤90s mobile intake, pilot cycle‑time compression) make the case with clarity *Design Epic: VDP – NCP Phase 1 (UX‑2997); ACVA‑89; UX‑3146*.

Where data is incomplete (e.g., pre‑MAX roles, revenue attribution), the report is explicit. Enabling Slack enterprise search and pulling HR/LinkedIn records would complete the picture. The absence of inflated claims is itself a credibility signal *Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review*.

### 8.2 Quantitative and qualitative evidence supports promotion readiness

**Business impact:** 88.7% retention, 210 rooftops, CIS 30; conversion enablement via in‑MAX Guaranteed Offers; faster time‑to‑task on mobile with zero P0/P1 at launch *UX‑2997; ACVA‑69; ACVA‑89*.

**Delivery/process impact:** design‑to‑code 2–4 days pilot target (vs. 20–45 baseline); single‑iteration handoff; reusable AI UX patterns; DS adoption with KPIs/ownership *UX‑3146; ACVA‑58; ACVA‑76*.

**Cross‑functional enablement:** Jira process adoption, dev‑handoff checklists, onboarding/stakeholder materials; visible weekly updates; engineered collaboration with Product/Eng/UXR *JIRA Process ACV Retail; UX‑2234; ACV Retail – UX Visibility (ACVA‑79)*.

These are not isolated wins; they form a coherent operating model that benefits the entire ACV Retail portfolio.

### 8.3 Key strengths: shipping complex projects, scaling via systems/process, quantifying outcomes, enabling cross‑functional teams

Chad's strengths are mutually reinforcing. He ships complex, multi‑dependency work; he scales his influence by building systems and processes others can use; he insists on measurable outcomes and instruments experiences to observe them; and he architects collaboration so that Product, Engineering, and UXR can move faster together *Chad Dunbar 2025 Performance Impact*.

In growth companies, this profile is rare and disproportionately valuable. It reduces risk while increasing speed, and it leaves a durable legacy of capability that persists beyond individual projects.
