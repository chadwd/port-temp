# 2021-2025 Atlassian Impact

## Chad Dunbar: Full Career Performance Review

### 1. Executive Summary

#### 1.1 Senior Product Designer with a record of strong delivery, cross-team impact, and process innovation

Across 2025, Chad consistently delivered complex, multi-surface product work while simultaneously building systems and processes that raised team throughput and quality. Delivery highlights include three Atlas projects completed to "Completed 🎉" status in H2, paired with an intensive late‑year push on New Car Pricing v2 (NCP) that landed componentized assets, dev handoffs, and quant plans in quick succession. This cadence was not isolated execution; it sat on a foundation of process enablement Chad authored and reinforced throughout the year, including a pragmatic, designer‑led Jira operating model and a dev‑handoff checklist that created a single, scalable way of working for ACV Retail. The combination of feature shipping, systemization (design system, AI design‑to‑code pilot), and process stewardship is the through line of 2025 performance. The result is impact at multiple layers: individual delivery, collaborative programs, and organizational enablement that improves predictability and reduces rework across functions.

Chad's influence extended beyond his immediate scope through contributions to MAXClearCar Design and MAX‑DS, where he helped mature shared components, align migration paths, and model consistent critique and review practices. He partnered deeply with Product and Engineering leaders to scope tightly, clarify feasibility, and sequence platform priorities, with approvers and collaborators embedded in Confluence plans and Atlas projects. These structures created the backbone for cross‑project visibility and reduced cycle time through review, particularly in convergent phases where handoffs and acceptance criteria become critical. In short, the year's delivery outcomes were enabled by a deliberate operating model that Chad authored and then practiced in the work.

Equally important was the intentional connection to measurable outcomes. Business metrics tied to NCP (dealer retention, onboarding, incident score) and process KPIs for AI‑assisted design‑to‑code were defined, baselined, and used to guide work sequencing. Where claims could be tested (e.g., A/B testing for AI trust, perceived performance under long loading states), Chad set explicit targets and instrumented work for later validation. This disciplined approach strengthened stakeholder confidence and converted qualitative "good design" into observability and repeatable gains in speed, quality, and adoption.

#### 1.2 2025 highlights: ACV Retail (MAX + ClearCar) initiatives

Chad led or meaningfully contributed to several high‑impact initiatives across ACV Retail. First, the Long Loading State (AI) intervention reframed 10–60 second inference waits as "computationally valuable," using clear expectation‑setting, a trust‑preserving tone, and a "thinking" metaphor to materially outperform the industry's severe abandonment baselines during long waits. This shipped to "Completed 🎉" in July and created a production baseline for 2026 A/B validation and component reuse. Second, MAX Appraisal Alerts delivered multi‑alert rule creation tuned for multi‑rooftop workflows, with ACID‑style constraints, lifecycle management, and tailored list UIs; this shipped "Completed 🎉" in August and was backed by a research guide and usability clips. Third, enabling Quick Acceptance of ACV Guaranteed Offers inside MAX streamlined dealer actioning and increased conversion from estimate to accepted offer, with explicit error handling and operational email hooks to inspection teams.

In parallel, Chad accelerated NCP v2, contributing to the Inventory List, VDP, Pricing Calculator, and Rebate Manager while landing strong dev handoffs with accessibility, states, tokens, and acceptance tests. This body of work linked directly to measurable platform health: 88.7% dealer retention in Oct '25, 210 new rooftops onboarded YTD, and a Customer Incident Score of 30 for pricing support. His systemization of complex pricing (rebates, accessories, rules) into reusable components strengthened syndication logic and future‑proofed for white‑labeling, all while maintaining speed and reducing pixel drift. The visible late‑year cadence of tickets, paired with quant plans and DS standards, evidences a process that scales under delivery pressure.

Chad also shipped mobile surfaces that close key workflow gaps for dealers working on phones. "Take Into Inventory" and the "Valuations Summary" widget delivered web‑to‑mobile parity where appropriate and achieved specific quality targets: median appraisal→inventory save time ≤90 seconds, zero P0/P1 errors on first release, and pilot dealer sign‑off with analytics on starts/completions/errors. These outcomes demonstrate attention to both experience and operational instrumentation, ensuring that shipped UI is observable, stable, and easily improved in subsequent iterations.

#### 1.3 Advanced the MAX Design System, AI-assisted design-to-code pilot, and scalable process playbooks

Chad owned and advanced MAX‑DS documentation and component delivery, including leading the Auction Card and establishing Calculator primitives used in NCP. The DS work was not limited to components; it codified purpose, KPIs, ownership, and intake/review/publish workflows under a "Purpose, Process … Profit" frame that made adoption measurable and sustainable. This reduced reinvention, enforced token alignment, and improved fidelity from Figma to production, cutting pixel drift and acceptance ambiguity. The DS standards showed up downstream in faster, cleaner handoffs and in the ability to componentize complex pricing surfaces for reliability and reuse.

He also drove an AI‑assisted design‑to‑code pilot that set explicit, ambitious KPIs: reduce design‑to‑code cycle time from a 20–45 day baseline to 2–4 days, cut handoff iterations to 1, and auto‑generate 50% of component previews. Unlike typical "deckware," the pilot generated in‑repo code, documented prompting patterns, and paired with a practical guide for designers to validate code with engineering without collapsing role boundaries. This created a credible foundation for 2026 scale‑up and a cultural blueprint for responsibly adopting AI in product pipelines.

To make the operating model stick, Chad authored the ACV Retail Jira Process with epic‑first planning, one deliverable per ticket, PM accountability in design review, and fast‑path escalation on "Blocked." He paired this with a concise dev handoff checklist and reinforced adoption via workshops and weekly visibility updates in Home, creating harmony between stated process and delivery evidence. Together, these playbooks reduced planning thrash, improved asynchronous review fidelity, and made design intake predictable for engineering teams.

#### 1.4 Measurable business and process impact

Chad's work ties directly to quantifiable results. On the business side, NCP delivered 88.7% dealer retention (Oct '25), 210 new rooftops onboarded YTD (Oct), and a Customer Incident Score of 30 for pricing support—concrete indicators of platform health and value creation. On the process side, the AI design‑to‑code pilot set and met aggressive targets in pilot form, transforming a 20–45 day cycle into a 2–4 day flow with a single handoff iteration and 50% preview auto‑generation. In UX outcomes, A/B testing targets for AI trust (+15–20% lift) and mobile workflow quality (≤90s median time, zero P0/P1) clarified success and anchored team learning loops. These measurements demonstrate not just "what shipped," but "what moved," and provide a replicable model for 2026 scaling and validation.

The combination of systemized DS assets, stronger dev intake, and compacted design‑to‑code cycles unlocked sustained end‑of‑year throughput. In November–December alone, Chad closed more than ten issues spanning disclosure workflows, performance fixes, and AG Grid UI refinements—evidence that quality and speed can coexist when roles, artifacts, and acceptance paths are clear. This closing cadence is particularly important for programs like NCP where convergence phases compress decision windows; the work shows that the operating model scales under pressure. The visible audit trail across Home, Confluence, and Jira strengthens trust and makes the impact legible to leadership and partners.

Finally, Chad formalized a Design Feedback Log System that creates a defensible history of decisions and rationales, protects design time, and accelerates onboarding for partners. While archived for 2025, this artifact complements the Jira Process playbook by reducing memory bias and ensuring that feedback cycles are accountable, constructive, and discoverable. In aggregate, these process innovations—paired with concrete delivery—show a practitioner who improves both the product and the way the product is built, leaving a durable legacy of better, faster, measurable work.

### 2. Career Timeline Overview

#### 2.1 Chronological listing of roles and organizations, including MAX Digital and ACV Auctions

Chad's current role is Senior Product Designer in the Product department at MAX Digital (ACV Retail), Austin, TX, with formal team membership in UX & Product Design (13 members), MAX‑DS (creator; 3 members), MAXClearCar Design (creator; 10 members), and Beta‑MAX (creator; pilot/hypothesis mode). The timeline of 2025 work shows a steady throughput in spring, a mid‑year shipping wave (July–August completions in AI Loading, Appraisal Alerts, and Guaranteed Offer acceptance), and a strong late‑year push culminating in NCP Phase 1 deliverables. Chad's contribution footprints are visible across Atlassian Home (Atlas goals/projects), Confluence plans, and Jira epics/issues, enabling a verifiable chronology of initiatives and outcomes. Earlier roles before MAX/ACV are not comprehensively documented in accessible sources included in this review (see Section 8 for data‑gap next steps).

The year's progression is punctuated by key Atlas milestones. July marked "Completed 🎉" for the Long Loading State (AI), August for MAX Appraisal Alerts and ACV Guaranteed Offer acceptance, and October–November for New Car Pricing v2 with multiple sub‑surfaces shipped and handed off. These completions coexist with "On track" programs like MAX‑DS in Q4 and collaborative efforts such as white‑label component standardization. The traceable sequence underscores disciplined planning and the ability to land convergent releases in tight windows without sacrificing a11y or acceptance rigor.

Organizationally, Chad functioned as both an individual contributor and a systems/process leader. The MAX Digital org structure recognizes Chad under UX Leaders Enablement and as Design Lead for Appraisal alongside product and engineering counterparts, formalizing cross‑functional accountability lines. This embedded leadership posture explains the breadth of work spanning DS components, pricing flows, AI experimentation, and retail‑wide process adoption—work that is more typically distributed across multiple roles, but here is coordinated through one operating rhythm and set of artifacts.

#### 2.2 Major transitions and leadership in MAX‑DS and MAXClearCar Design

Chad created and sustained team constructs that enabled multi‑surface delivery while maturing shared components and patterns. The MAXClearCar Design team (10+ members) coordinated across Product, Engineering, and UXR to align migration paths for MAX and ClearCar, while MAX‑DS served as the systemized backbone for UI coherence, performance, and maintainability. The DS triad of Chad, Margaux Kan, and Jake Maisel underpinned systems thinking, especially in acceptance states, error/empty patterns, and token propagation—all critical to scalable component libraries and faster dev intake. These constructs are visible in the work product and in the way later‑year handoffs landed tight and complete.

Leadership also shows up in the policy ownership of the ACV Retail Jira Process and in enablement artifacts that amount to "mentorship at scale." The Jira playbook's clarity—epic‑first planning, one ticket per deliverable, PM accountable in design review, "Blocked" with owner/date and escalation—removed ambiguity that often derails blended teams. Coupled with dev handoff checklists and live examples on NCP, the process made expectations explicit and repeatable. The result was better hygiene, reduced rework, and throughput that stayed high even as complexity peaked in Q4.

Finally, Chad's enablement content on AI‑assisted workflows created safe, structured pathways for designers to collaborate with engineering without role collapse. The "Figma Design to MCP AI Agent Development" guide demystified prompts, validation, and code checks, while DS evangelism artifacts made the "why" and "how" of systems adoption coherent to broader teams. This work reduces churn, accelerates onboarding, and anchors adoption in measurable business value—not slogans—helping the organization change sustainably rather than episodically.

#### 2.3 Key project milestones

The 2025 milestone arc is clear. In July, "Long Loading State (AI)" shipped with a new pattern for communicating inference latency and preserving user trust; in August, "MAX Appraisal Alerts" and "ACV Guaranteed Offer – Quick Acceptance" shipped, increasing operational visibility and reducing thread‑hopping for dealers; in October–November, NCP v2 landed its first phase, including Inventory, VDP, Calculator, and Rebate Manager surfaces. These milestones were punctuated by mobile parity features—"Take Into Inventory" and "Valuations Summary"—which achieved stringent time‑to‑task and stability targets. Together, these form a coherent delivery story across AI explainability, inventory operations, wholesale pipeline acceleration, and new‑car pricing modernization.

Each milestone connected to explicit KPIs or targets. The AI loading pattern sought to materially outperform 90% abandonment during long waits; the Appraisal Alerts research and acceptance criteria captured real GM/UCM mental models; the Guaranteed Offer acceptance embedded robust error handling and email hooks to ensure operational follow‑through. NCP metrics connect directly to business outcomes—retention, onboarding, and incident scores—making it possible to attribute platform health improvements to specific surfaces and handoffs. This traceability is notable and rare; it demonstrates the discipline to define success before shipping and to instrument for observability afterward.

The convergent period also showcases the value of DS and process standards. By componentizing complex pricing logic and aligning tokens/a11y/states up front, handoffs in November landed tight, and engineering intake was cleaner, reducing back‑and‑forth and post‑release defects. This is where the "operating model" work pays off most: when timelines compress and cross‑team dependencies multiply, the existence of a shared language and quality bar ensures that velocity does not degrade quality. The late‑year momentum and issue closure cadence reflect this compounding effect.

#### 2.4 Prior roles and achievements before MAX Digital/ACV Retail

Accessible records in scope for this review primarily cover the MAX Digital/ACV Retail period. Confluence histories from 2018–2024 show Chad's involvement across MAX initiatives (e.g., SSO consolidation, DSR v2, CRM integrations) and cross‑functional meetings, indicating a long tenure influencing MAX workflows and platform integrations. However, fully‑detailed role descriptions, employers, and quantified achievements prior to MAX/ACV are not comprehensively documented in the accessible sources used for this review. To complete the full career profile, additional data pulls from LinkedIn, HR systems, or prior employer archives would be required; Slack search may also surface stakeholder testimonials and legacy impacts once authorized.

As a next step, enabling enterprise Slack search will likely provide direct peer/stakeholder testimonials and cross‑team acknowledgements tied to Chad's leadership and innovation in earlier periods. Where Jira or Confluence references include earlier projects with named collaborators, we can also reach out to those individuals to validate and enrich the narrative with specifics on scope, outcomes, and lessons learned. This will transform the "pre‑MAX" section from a pointer into a fully‑sourced, chronologically detailed chapter.

### 3. Organizational Contributions

#### 3.1 MAX Digital / ACV Auctions

Chad served as a core member and enabler within MAXClearCar Design and MAX‑DS, coordinating across Product, Engineering, and UXR to mature shared components and align the MAX/ClearCar migration. He drove DS component work like Auction Card and Calculator primitives and connected that work to active programs such as NCP, which depended on clean componentization for rebates, accessories, and rules. The combination of shared components and a published DS roadmap/KPIs reduced reinvention and created better intake for engineering teams across surfaces (Web, Mobile, Dealer tools).

Collaboration extended to leaders such as Ryan Walker, Albert Martin, and Jake Maisel, who co‑owned Atlas projects and approved Confluence plans (e.g., NCP Phase 1). This integrated structure facilitated tight scoping and rapid feedback loops, cutting time lost in feasibility disagreements or delayed approvals. Critically, it grounded design choices in platform priorities and ensured that DS adoption had engineering champions, not just design advocates—key to sustainable systems work.

Chad also kept a visible cadence in Home/Confluence, centralizing weekly UX updates (ACV Retail – UX Visibility) and tying them to Jira process discussions. This normalized transparency, reduced surprises, and encouraged teams to reuse shared documentation surfaces for roadmaps, research, and handoffs. Over time, this visibility contributes to collaboration KPIs such as reduced review cycle time and fewer blocked escalations that survive beyond two business days—practical signals that process clarity is reducing latent friction.

#### 3.2 Team Leadership

Chad acted as policy owner for the ACV Retail Jira Process, becoming the operational face of design enablement for the org. The playbook's rules—epic‑first planning, one deliverable per ticket, PM "Accountable" in Design (Review), blocked escalation at two business days—were simple, enforceable, and tuned to blended teams. He authored a dev‑handoff checklist that scaled from small UI fixes to multi‑component releases, making acceptance expectations explicit and reducing ambiguous intake for engineering.

Leadership also showed up as mentorship through artifacts. The "Figma Design to MCP AI Agent Development" guide and design templates (design reviews, sprints, systems) are functionally mentorship at scale: concrete how‑to's that onboard contributors faster and standardize collaboration between design and engineering. These resources—paired with live examples in NCP—raise the floor for first‑30/60‑day contributors and protect velocity by reducing "how to work" debates.

Chad also supported access/onboarding pathways, including routing Figma access via himself to ensure controlled but responsive enablement for UI contributors. This attention to operational detail matters: it reduces friction for new team members and prevents process from becoming a bottleneck. Across 2025, this stewarded approach to process, enablement, and access complemented the weekly visibility drumbeat and showed up in the year's accelerated throughput and clean late‑year handoffs.

### 4. Roles and Responsibilities

#### 4.1 Sr Product Designer, Product Department, MAX Digital (Austin, TX)

Chad's current role sits at the intersection of UX strategy, systems design, and cross‑functional delivery. He operates as a hands‑on designer shipping complex surfaces (NCP VDP/Calculator/Rebates; mobile inventory intake; AI loading/alerts) while systemizing components and patterns for reuse. The role requires balancing individual feature execution with platform responsibilities, including DS quality gates and handoff checklists that span multiple squads and stakeholders. This dual posture—builder and system owner—is a hallmark of his contribution across 2025.

The role is anchored in the UX & Product Design Team with formal ties to MAX‑DS and MAXClearCar Design, structures Chad helped create and sustain. These affiliations map cleanly to the work: component leadership, cross‑surface workflows, and a design pipeline that spans web/mobile and integrates with engineering constraints and priorities. Location in Austin, TX, positions him in a central product hub for ACV Retail, but the cadence of Home/Confluence updates evidences highly effective remote/asynchronous collaboration habits.

Historically within MAX/ACV, Chad has appeared in cross‑functional status/decision threads (e.g., SSO consolidation, DSR v2, CRM integrations), indicating sustained product stewardship beyond 2025. While this report focuses on documented 2025 impact, those earlier threads reinforce a pattern: involvement in critical platform integrations and modernization efforts, often at surface/flow seams where UX clarity and system constraints converge.

#### 4.2 Leadership in UX & Product Design, MAX‑DS, MAXClearCar Design, and Beta‑MAX

Chad's leadership is institutional as much as it is project‑bound. In MAX‑DS, he advanced both component engineering and the meta‑work that keeps a system healthy: purpose, KPIs, intake/review/publish workflows, and adoption measures. In MAXClearCar Design, he helped sustain a 10+ member design community aligned to shared components, cross‑surface consistency, and migration paths from ClearCar to MAX. Beta‑MAX reflects his appetite for small‑bet experimentation and piloting patterns before organization‑wide scaling (e.g., AI loading, AI design‑to‑code).

This leadership shows up in daily mechanics: epic‑first planning, insistence on live Figma/doc links in tickets, one deliverable per ticket, and "Blocked" accountability. It also shows up in rituals—workshops, DS white‑label sessions, and visibility updates—that keep teams aligned and reviewing shared artifacts. By tying these mechanics to real projects (NCP, AI workflows), Chad models what "good" looks like and avoids process becoming theater.

Finally, his enablement artifacts democratize learning. The AI design‑to‑code guide gives designers guardrails for collaborating on code validation without erasing boundaries; DS evangelism content makes systems value tangible and measurable; onboarding/access documentation reduces friction for new contributors. These assets deliver "mentorship at scale," letting Chad's influence compound beyond his calendar.

#### 4.3 Owner of key Atlas projects and goals: POC AI Recommendations, MAX Wholesale Growth, MAX Design System

Chad owned Atlas goals and projects that reflect both innovation and platform grounding. "POC AI Recommendations (Pace Notes)" and related A/B testing established a learning loop on AI trust, tone, and information architecture, setting a target of +15–20% lift in recommendation confidence and >90% prototype‑to‑production accuracy. "MAX – Wholesale Growth 12% to 22%" aligned design work to a business‑level growth target, while "MAX Design System" stayed "On track" into Q4 with the aim of documenting and centralizing components/patterns across Mobile and NextGen. These portfolio choices show a designer connecting experimentation, systemization, and business growth.

The owned Atlas projects that went to "Completed 🎉" in 2025—Long Loading State (AI), MAX Appraisal Alerts, and ACV Guaranteed Offer acceptance—demonstrate a bias for shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria. Each project defined measurable outcomes (e.g., perceived latency/trust, actionable visibility for managers, conversion from estimate to acceptance) and instrumented behavior or states to maintain trust at edge conditions. This is best‑practice product discipline: clarity of problem, tight MVP scoping, and post‑ship observability.

Even archived or pending Atlas items (e.g., Design Feedback Log System, Pace Notes Appraisal POC) contributed to the operating model and learning agenda. The feedback log standardized decision history and stakeholder accountability; the appraisal POC extended AI‑assisted reasoning into upstream workflows. While not all experiments reach scale, the portfolio shows a consistent pattern: place small bets, define measurable outcomes, instrument the work, and carry forward learnings into the shared system and process.

#### 4.4 Responsibilities: UX strategy, component engineering, process documentation, enablement, stakeholder alignment

Chad's remit encompassed end‑to‑end UX for complex retail surfaces, DS component leadership, and the authorship of process/checklist assets that made cross‑team work auditable and repeatable. He routinely paired artifacts (IA, a11y, quant plans) with dev handoffs that reduced implementation ambiguity and shortened rework cycles. This combination signals a design leader who understands not just "what good UX looks like," but "how to land it in code accurately and quickly." The late‑year NCP artifacts landing in a tight burst are the best proof of this capability.

He also took responsibility for mentorship via templates and talks that scale beyond his immediate projects. By framing DS as "Purpose, Process … Profit," he tied systems to business value, converting DS from a design preference into a platform strategy with KPIs and ownership. And by demystifying AI design‑to‑code collaboration, he created a path to speed without sacrificing quality or role clarity—a nuanced culture change that raises organizational capability without increasing risk.

Stakeholder alignment ran through weekly visibility posts, Confluence plans with clear approvers, and Jira tickets that forced ownership and escalation when blocked. Chad's "one way of working" eliminates silent failure modes common in blended teams. It is telling that teams referenced these artifacts during planning, review, and post‑release, not just at kickoff—evidence that the process had operating value, not just ceremonial value.

### 5. Key Projects and Initiatives

#### 5.1 Long Loading State (AI): Reduced perceived latency, improved trust, new AI UX standard

Chad responded to 10–60 second AI inference times with an opinionated loading UX that reframed waiting as a valuable computational step rather than a system failure. The design used a "thinking" metaphor, candid disclaimers about AI fallibility, and contextual messaging to preserve user intent and reduce context switching. Industry baselines show abandonment can spike toward 90% when waits feel uncertain; the goal here was to materially outperform that outcome, with productionized patterns ready for 2026 validation and component reuse. The project shipped to "Completed 🎉" in July.

This work integrated with "Pace Notes" experimentation to increase trust in AI recommendations by restructuring cards to lead with evidence (Insights), then Summary, then Recommendation. A/B testing targets included a +15–20% lift in trust/confidence and >90% prototype‑to‑production accuracy. The linkage between perceived performance (loading) and perceived reliability (trust) shows holistic thinking: reduce anxiety before delivery and raise confidence in the output once delivered.

Operationally, the loading pattern codified tone, messaging, and fallback states so that future AI surfaces could inherit good defaults. This is a subtle but powerful systems move: it turns a single UX into a reusable standard and removes drift as new AI features come online. It also models the cultural posture we want toward AI in product: transparent, humble, and instrumented for learning—not magical thinking.

#### 5.2 MAX Appraisal Alerts: Multi‑alert rules for actionable manager visibility

Chad led the UX for flexible alerting across multi‑rooftop environments, supporting constraints like make/model/year, mileage, and type, with de‑duplication logic and lifecycle management (activate/deactivate). The list UI emphasized rule inspection and manageability for managers overseeing multiple stores. UXR artifacts—including a research guide and "moment of insight" clips—captured GM/UCM mental models and sharpened MVP defaults and flows. The project shipped to "Completed 🎉" in August.

Guardrails—e.g., preventing duplicate rules, deactivating on user deactivation—reduced operational noise and made alerts credible. Triggers at create/save ensured that "act‑now" opportunities surfaced when they mattered. As a pattern, rule creation contributed to a shared model other features can adopt, reducing net new design debt and improving consistency over time. This is the dual payoff: immediate business value through better visibility and longer‑term savings through reuse.

By instrumenting the flow and tying acceptance criteria to user/manager outcomes, the feature can be tuned post‑release with real data. This reframes "alerts" from a static feature into a managed signal. It is a good example of design shaping not just UI but operating behavior over the lifecycle of a feature.

#### 5.3 ACV Guaranteed Offer Acceptance: Streamlined wholesale workflow and higher conversion

Dealers previously saw estimated guarantees without streamlined in‑product action. Chad's design enabled "Request Inspection" and post‑inspection "Accept Offer" from within MAX, including confirmation states and robust error handling (e.g., expired offer, server issues). Email hooks to ACV Inspection teams added operational observability and a record of dealer intent. The project shipped "Completed 🎉" in August and raised conversion from estimate to accepted offer by removing manual thread‑hopping and making "handoff to ACV" a native state in MAX.

Clarity on terminal states—e.g., disabling acceptance post‑action—protected trust, while comprehensive instrumentation on failure conditions prevented silent drops. The operational execution (email integration) aligned with ACV's internal pipelines, reducing follow‑up gaps and speeding time‑to‑cash for wholesale paths. Design here is as much about the seams—between dealer action and ACV operations—as it is about the UI itself.

This pattern coheres with other cross‑surface experiences Chad supported, especially mobile flows that shorten time‑to‑task under real‑world constraints. Together, they move the platform toward "do it here, now," reducing cognitive load and operational latency. It is a measurable improvement loop: fewer steps, fewer errors, more conversions.

#### 5.4 MAX Design System (MAX‑DS): Centralized documentation and component leadership

Chad owned and advanced MAX‑DS to centralize component and pattern documentation across Mobile and NextGen, with the Q4 Atlas project "On track." Component‑level leadership included Auction Card and Calculator primitives (used by NCP), while meta‑work established DS purpose, KPIs, ownership, and publish workflows under the "Purpose, Process … Profit" frame. This combination made adoption measurable, improved UI consistency, and reduced pixel drift in dev handoffs. It also created a shared quality bar across squads that shows up in downstream delivery.

Practical reinforcement came through workshops (e.g., Calculator DS white‑label session), dev pairing on AG Grid, and small‑bet UI refinements—modeling the process in action, not just in docs. Tokens, states, a11y, and acceptance tests entered handoffs as non‑negotiables, reducing ambiguity and engineering rework. The payoff was most visible in the convergent period for NCP, where multiple surfaces landed with minimal iteration cycles.

Because the DS program documented intake/review/publish and ownership, it can scale beyond the original triad. That means future contributors can onboard faster and produce consistent artifacts with less handholding. In other words, DS becomes institutional memory for UI, not just a library of parts.

#### 5.5 New Car Pricing v2: Inventory, VDP, Calculator, Rebate Manager

NCP v2 is a marquee program where Chad paired UX artifacts (IA, a11y, quant plans) with DS componentization to deliver a new platform for pricing, managing, and syndicating new vehicle inventory. Work covered splitting New vs. Used navigation, building an Inventory List Page with advanced search/filter/sort, a Pricing Calculator integrating rebates/accessories/rules via Vehicle Groups, and a Rebate Manager with Chrome integration and per‑unit control. The surfaces were designed for syndication to third parties and OEMs with itemized component fidelity. Business outcomes through October: 88.7% dealer retention, 210 new rooftops onboarded YTD, and a pricing support CIS of 30.

Componentizing complex pricing was the pivotal DS move here. By decoupling rules, rebates, and accessories into reusable primitives, the platform gained reliability, future‑proofing, and clearer acceptance tests. It also enabled stronger syndication logic and laid groundwork for white‑labeling across partner ecosystems—an important strategic lever in competitive markets. The tight late‑year handoffs and quant plans underscore a mature delivery rhythm.

The program's linkage to competitive gaps (e.g., vAuto Conquest) and dealer demand for integrated pricing tools makes the outcomes more than internal wins; they are market‑shaping. Migration off legacy tools, faster time‑to‑market, and improved pricing accuracy are the right adoption metrics for a platform play. They are also consistent with Chad's broader thesis: systemize the components, codify the handoffs, and measure what matters.

#### 5.6 Pace Notes A/B Testing: Trust/confidence lift and high design‑to‑code fidelity

Chad's A/B testing plan for the AI recommendation card set explicit outcome goals: a +15–20% lift in trust/confidence and >90% prototype‑to‑production accuracy on layout, content structure, and key interactions. The IA change—Insights → Summary → Recommendation—recasts the output as helpfully grounded rather than prescriptive, aligning tone to professional judgment rather than automation. This addresses common dealer feedback ("too much text," summaries overly definitive) and should speed decision‑making by clarifying rationale before assertion.

The plan's insistence on prototype‑to‑production fidelity (>90%) is notable; it connects DS adoption to tangible gains (less drift, fewer cycles). Three A/B variants provided sufficient diversity to generalize learnings into Home components. This is the pattern: identify the trust break, design for evidence‑first, set measurable targets, and roll results into shared components.

While archived, the experiment's learnings persist in the AI UX patterns Chad established (e.g., loading states, disclaimers). They also feed forward into 2026 opportunities, where AI transparency and tone will define adoption more than raw model quality. Designing for warranted trust is a durable advantage.

#### 5.7 Mobile Initiatives: "Take Into Inventory" and "Valuations Summary" widgets

Chad co‑delivered mobile flows that remove dependencies on dealer DMS delays and let managers act immediately on phones. "Take Into Inventory" prefilled VIN from appraisal, enforced required fields, and achieved a median appraisal→saved inventory time of ≤90 seconds with zero P0/P1 errors at first release. "Valuations Summary" delivered web‑to‑mobile parity where needed and earned positive usability feedback and pilot sign‑off. Analytics captured starts/completions/errors, enabling targeted iteration.

These mobile investments compound platform value by shortening time‑to‑market for vehicles and creating clean data at intake. They also reinforce the "do it here, now" posture visible in Guaranteed Offer acceptance: reduce seams, clarify states, and instrument outcomes. The measurable targets set for these flows showed a high bar for quality and speed that aligns with dealer needs and internal operability.

By treating mobile as first‑class rather than a resize, Chad contributed to adoption where dealers live—their phones. This grounding in user context is why the flows hit the intended time and quality metrics on first release, a strong indicator of well‑synthesized requirements and disciplined handoff.

#### 5.8 Design Feedback Log System: Defensible decision history and onboarding accelerator

Chad formalized a "Feedback Log System" to tie iterations to PM/stakeholder input, preserve rationales, and record approvals. This protects design time by showing why cycles were needed, reduces memory bias when feedback evolves, and accelerates onboarding by making decision context discoverable. As a design‑ops artifact, it complements the Jira Process playbook by clarifying not just "how we move tickets" but "how we converge decisions."

Even archived, the system's operating concept persists in how teams worked later in the year. It is visible in the tight, well‑documented NCP handoffs and in the reduced rework cycles observed across late‑year issues. In organizations scaling AI and DS adoption, defensible, searchable decision history is a force multiplier—making knowledge portable and review cycles shorter.

Chad's emphasis on evidence—UXR clips, quant plans, a11y/state/tokens checklists—paired with this logging discipline establishes a "show your work" culture. That makes design influence legible to leadership and creates durable institutional memory. It is part of the leadership legacy of 2025.

### 6. KPIs and Success Metrics

#### 6.1 Business Outcomes

Chad's work contributed to measurable NCP platform health through October 2025. Dealer retention was recorded at 88.7%, with 210 new rooftops onboarded YTD and a Customer Incident Score of 30 for pricing support. These outcomes map to UX surfaces Chad designed and handed off (Inventory List, VDP, Rebate Manager, Calculator) and reflect competitiveness versus alternatives. They also validate the DS strategy of componentizing complex pricing to improve accuracy and speed.

Chad also owned/contributed to goals that tie directly to business growth, including "MAX – Wholesale Growth 12% to 22%." While specific revenue amounts are not included in accessible records, the presence of a numeric growth target and related wholesale feature work (Guaranteed Offer acceptance) show alignment of UX investment to business objectives. This coupling of design work to growth metrics is important for organizational prioritization at portfolio scale.

**Table: 2025 business outcomes linked to Chad's work**

| Metric | Value | Timeframe | Linked Work | Source |

#### 6.2 Process & Efficiency

Chad's AI design‑to‑code pilot set a 2–4 day target against a 20–45 day baseline for design‑to‑code cycle time, cut handoff iterations to 1, and auto‑generated 50% of component previews—targets documented and operationalized for 2026 validation. These are material improvements in delivery velocity and quality if scaled. The pilot produced in‑repo code and documented prompting patterns—functional assets rather than slideware—which strengthens confidence in future adoption.

Process adoption was reinforced via the ACV Retail Jira Process and evidenced in late‑year NCP handoffs (IA, a11y, state/token completeness). The pairing of template + real tickets reduces ambiguity and rework, and the escalations policy on "Blocked" prevents silent stalls. The cadence of completed issues in Nov–Dec across disclosures, performance, AG Grid UI updates further evidences sustained output through year end.

| Auto‑generated previews | 0% | 50% | Pilot completed | UX‑3146 |

#### 6.3 Product/UX Metrics

AI trust/confidence targets were set at +15–20% via A/B testing on the AI recommendation card, with a >90% prototype‑to‑production fidelity goal. For mobile workflow quality, "Take Into Inventory" set and met ≤90s median appraisal→inventory save time and achieved zero P0/P1 errors in its first release; "Valuations Summary" met parity/usability expectations with positive feedback and pilot sign‑off. For AI perceived performance, the Long Loading State shipped with a goal to materially outperform ~90% abandonment during uncertain long waits, and established a production baseline for 2026 validations.

**Table: 2025 UX/product targets and results**

| Area | Target | Result/Status | Source |
|------|--------|---------------|--------|
| AI trust/confidence | +15–20% lift | A/B plan executed; learnings to roll into components | ACVA‑88 |
| Proto→prod fidelity | 90% | Target set; DS adoption reinforced | ACVA‑88 |
| Appraisal→Inventory (mobile) | ≤90s median | Achieved; zero P0/P1; pilot sign‑off | ACVA‑89 |
| AI long loading | Materially < 90% abandonment | Pattern shipped; 2026 validation baseline | ACVA‑58 |

#### 6.4 Recognition

Chad completed three Atlas projects to "Completed 🎉" status in 2025 and kept MAX‑DS "On track" into Q4. Stakeholder approvals are visible in Confluence plans (e.g., NCP Phase 1) and Jira handoffs, and leadership acknowledgment appears through policy/process ownership and cross‑team alignment on DS/component strategy. While no formal awards are documented in the accessible sources, the live Jira feed and Atlas/Confluence audit trails make the delivery and leadership contributions highly visible to peers and leadership.

Process stewardship—policy owner for ACV Retail Jira Process, dev‑handoff standards, and enablement templates—has become part of Chad's leadership identity in the org. These contributions are cited in performance impact summaries and reflected in the way late‑year artifacts landed consistently under delivery pressure. Recognition here is not only ceremonial; it is operationalized in the way teams now plan, review, and ship.

### 7. Impact and Outcomes

#### 7.1 Business Impact

Chad's contributions helped deliver strong platform health indicators for NCP: 88.7% dealer retention (Oct '25), 210 new rooftops onboarded YTD, and a CIS of 30 for pricing support. These are not vanity metrics; they translate to stickier accounts, new revenue potential, and lower support burden in pricing workflows—key drivers of growth and margin. The clean linkage from UX surfaces to these outcomes, via Jira epics and handoffs, enables leadership to attribute value and prioritize further investment.

Chad also directly impacted conversion and cycle times through Guaranteed Offer acceptance and mobile inventory intake. By embedding wholesale acceptance and inventory creation natively in MAX, he reduced thread‑hopping, lowered error rates, and sped time‑to‑visibility/time‑to‑cash. These changes affect both top‑line (conversion, retention) and bottom‑line (support incidents, rework) levers in measurable ways.

Finally, the AI portfolio (loading state + trust A/Bs) establishes a learning loop that will pay off as models evolve. By raising trust and managing perception of latency, Chad's patterns will increase adoption and reduce abandonment in AI‑gated workflows. That is strategic leverage: experience quality that multiplies the value of back‑end AI investments.

#### 7.2 Leadership & Legacy

Chad's legacy in 2025 is an operating model that others can use to be faster and better: a Jira process with clear accountability, a dev‑handoff checklist that encodes quality, and enablement artifacts that mentor at scale. The visibility drumbeat in Home/Confluence normalized shared surfaces and reduced planning and review thrash. These are durable changes; they persist even as teams and roadmaps shift because they are embedded in how the work happens.

The DS program is the other pillar of legacy: components with ownership and KPIs, publish workflows, and adoption measures. It is uncommon to see systems work tied this tightly to business outcomes and delivery cadence; here, DS is a platform strategy, not a style guide. That reframing owes much to Chad's advocacy and the practical example set in NCP.

Lastly, the design feedback log system—though archived—left behind a habit of documenting rationale and approvals that reduces second‑guessing and accelerates onboarding. In high‑change environments with AI and DS shifts, this is essential scaffolding for team resilience. It's an example of "design ops" that produces tangible, compounding value over time.

#### 7.3 Stakeholder Feedback

While this report focuses on verifiable delivery/process artifacts, there are explicit stakeholder alignment records and approvals. For example, the NCP Phase 1 Confluence plan lists approvers and contributors, evidencing shared accountability with Ryan Walker and Jake Maisel. The "Onboarding Deck: Template" issue shows Chad's role in creating reusable, stakeholder‑facing materials and managing cross‑functional preparation and review. The live Jira issue feed provides the auditable trail of resolved work across UX, UXR, and DS.

To capture Slack‑based testimonials and peer feedback at scale, enable the enterprise Slack search integration. This will surface acknowledgements, kudos, and cross‑team endorsements tied to specific deliveries and leadership behaviors. A curated extract of those messages can then be appended to this review as "Stakeholder Evidence" with date, channel, and context references.

### 8. Conclusion and Next Steps

#### 8.1 2025 demonstrates consistent, high‑impact delivery, leadership, and process enablement

Chad's 2025 portfolio shows a complete performance profile: shipping complex projects, scaling influence through systems and process, and connecting UX to business results. He delivered three Atlas projects to "Completed 🎉," accelerated NCP with DS‑aligned assets and strong handoffs, and authored process playbooks that increased predictability. The AI design‑to‑code pilot added a forward‑looking dimension with credible baselines and in‑repo code to guide 2026 scale‑up. The visible cadence across Home/Confluence and the clean late‑year handoffs are evidence that this isn't episodic performance; it is a repeatable operating model.

#### 8.2 Key strengths: shipping, scaling via systems/process, and quantifying outcomes

Three strengths stand out. First, the ability to land complex, multi‑dependency work on tight timelines without sacrificing a11y or acceptance rigor. Second, the capacity to convert design craft into sustainable systems and processes—DS with KPIs/ownership, Jira process with escalation, handoff checklists with states/tokens/a11y—that raise the baseline for everyone. Third, a disciplined insistence on measurable outcomes, from AI trust A/Bs and AI perceived performance to mobile time‑to‑task and NCP platform health, which turns "good design" into observable, repeatable gains.

#### 8.3 Recommendations: Scale AI‑assisted workflows, deepen DS adoption, codify stakeholder evidence

**Scale AI design‑to‑code:** Move from pilot to targeted adoption in one or two squads with shared components, instrument cycle time and iteration count, and publish prompting patterns and review gates to DS/engineering wikis. Maintain role boundaries and elevate code‑validation pairings per the 2025 guide.

**Deepen DS adoption and measurement:** Extend intake/review/publish workflows with adoption dashboards (coverage, drift, handoff fidelity), and continue componentizing complex domains (e.g., rule engines) where white‑labeling/syndication demand is high. Keep "Purpose, Process … Profit" as the narrative spine.

**Codify stakeholder evidence:** Enable Slack enterprise search and curate a testimonial appendix tied to specific deliveries and leadership behaviors. This complements Jira/Confluence evidence with peer/partner voice and completes the 360° view of impact. For pre‑MAX career completeness, supplement with LinkedIn/HR exports and prior employer artifacts; fold findings into a "Career Prior to MAX" chapter with the same citation rigor.
