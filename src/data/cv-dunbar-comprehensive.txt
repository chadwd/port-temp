PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
================================================================================

Principal-level product designer with 15+ years building complex enterprise and
platform products. I turn ambiguity into clear, scalable systems across
AI-assisted workflows, design systems, and B2B SaaS. I partner tightly with
engineering to ship dev-ready work that teams can maintain.

Core Strengths:
- Platform and systems design for complex workflows
- Design systems architecture, tokens, and scalable patterns
- AI-assisted product workflows and trust-building UX
- Cross-functional leadership across Product, Engineering, and Research
- Strong documentation and decision clarity to reduce rework

  workflow using Figma MCP and Claude Code with documented prompting patterns

- Reduced handoff iterations from 3-5 cycles to 1 cycle by establishing
  repeatable code validation workflows and auto-generated component previews

- Outperformed 90% industry abandonment baseline during AI inference delays
  by designing trust-building loading states with "thinking" metaphors,
  clear disclaimers, and contextual messaging
