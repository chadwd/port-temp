Here are the most important takeaways from all the sources to help you rebuild your resume, organized into simple steps.

## 1\. The Golden Rule: Tailor, Don't Template

- **Customize every time**: Never send a generic resume. You must tailor your resume for each specific job application.  
- **Treat the job description as a "Menu"**: Look at what the employer is "ordering" (skills and requirements) and ensure your resume serves that exact dish. Don't list skills that aren't on their menu.  
- **Use the exact job title**: Place the specific job title you are applying for right at the top of your resume (e.g., "Senior Business Analyst") to immediately show alignment.

## 2\. Formatting & Layout (Keep it Simple)

- **Stick to one column**: Avoid two-column layouts. Many Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) cannot read them correctly, and your text might get scrambled.  
- **No graphics or photos**: Remove headshots, charts, and clip art. They confuse the software and take up valuable space.  
- **Standard fonts**: Use clean, professional fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Cambria at an 11-point size.  
- **Length**: A two-page resume is now considered the norm and is perfectly acceptable if you have experience.

## 3\. The "Top Fold" (First Impressions Matter)

- **The 6-Second Scan**: Recruiters often decide whether to keep reading in the first few seconds. Your top section must pop.  
- **Contact Info**: Keep it minimal. Name (large font), City/State (no street address), One phone number, One email, and a customized LinkedIn URL.  
- **Replace the "Objective"**: Old-style vague objectives are dead. Use a Professional Summary or "Executive Summary" that highlights your value proposition and top achievements immediately.  
- **Key Skills Trio**: Consider listing a "power-packed trio" of hard skills right under your headline (e.g., Data Analysis | Project Management | Python).

## 4\. Writing Your Experience (The "Google XYZ" Formula)

- **Ditch "Responsible For"**: Do not simply list your duties. Hiring managers want to know what you achieved, not just what you were supposed to do.  
- **Use the Google XYZ Formula**: Structure your bullet points as: "Accomplished \[X\] as measured by \[Y\], by doing \[Z\]".  
  - Example: "Increased regional sales by 25% (X) resulting in $1.2M revenue (Y) by implementing a new training program (Z)".  
- **Quantify everything**: Use numbers, dollars, and percentages. Did you save time? Save money? Increase revenue? Put a number on it.  
- **Contextualize skills**: Don't just list "Java" in a skills section. Mention it in a bullet point like "Built a payment system using Java that handled 10k transactions daily" to show how you use it.

## 5\. What to Remove (The "Outdated" List)

- **References**: Delete "References available upon request." It wastes space; they will ask for them later if needed.  
- **Full Address**: Privacy is key. City and State are sufficient.  
- **Dates for old education**: If you graduated more than 3 years ago, remove the graduation year to avoid age bias.  
- **Soft Skills lists**: Avoid a list of generic words like "Good communicator" or "Hard worker." Show these traits through your accomplishments instead.

## 6\. Optimizing for the ATS (The Digital Filing Cabinet)

- **Keywords are key**: Identify the specific words used in the job description and weave them naturally into your bullet points. Do not "stuff" keywords randomly or in white text.

## The Google XYZ Formula Explained

Based on the sources provided, specifically the resume masterclass from an ex-Google recruiter, the Google XYZ formula is a specific method for writing resume bullet points that focuses on impact rather than duties.

### The Components

The formula is structured as: **"Accomplished \[X\] as measured by \[Y\], by doing \[Z\]"**.

- **X (The Accomplishment)**: This represents the claim or the specific objective you achieved. It describes what you did.  
- **Y (The Measurement)**: This provides the evidence for your claim. You must use numbers, percentages, or dollar amounts to demonstrate the scale of your success. This answers the questions: Did you save money? Did you increase profits? Did you improve productivity?  
- **Z (The Method)**: This explains how you achieved the result. It details the specific strategy, program, or action you implemented to get from X to Y.

### Example

- **Bad**: "Responsible for overseeing marketing campaigns."  
- **Good (Using XYZ)**: "Directed a marketing campaign (X) that increased website traffic by 30% within 3 months (Y) by implementing targeted SEO strategies (Z)."

### The Purpose

The primary goal of the Google XYZ formula is to shift your resume from a list of "responsibilities" to a showcase of business value.

- **Proof of Competence**: Recruiters and hiring managers do not want to read a list of generic duties (e.g., "managed sales team"). They want to know the business impact you delivered and the results of your work.  
- **Credibility**: By using the "claim \+ evidence" approach (similar to XYZ), you substantiate your skills early on. Instead of saying you are a "results-driven professional," you prove it with hard data.  
- **Differentiation**: Using this formula helps you stand out from candidates who simply list what they were "responsible for" doing. It highlights how you solved problems and added value to the company.
