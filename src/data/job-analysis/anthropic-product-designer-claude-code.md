---

## The Problem They're Solving

Claude Code generated $1B in annualized revenue within 6 months, but the product spans **terminal, IDE extensions, web, and Slack** — each requiring distinct interaction patterns for autonomous AI behavior. They need someone who can design across these surfaces while keeping the experience cohesive, especially as model capabilities evolve rapidly.

**Their biggest pain points:**
1. **Agentic AI UX patterns don't exist yet** — progress communication, permission requests, and failure handling need design invention, not templates
2. **Rapid model iteration creates design instability** — specs are ambiguous because capabilities shift weekly; need design-test-refine cycles aligned with research
3. **Developer tools demand craft precision** — information density, keyboard-first interaction, and zero-friction workflows are table stakes for this audience
4. **Multi-surface consistency at speed** — terminal, IDE, web, and Slack all need unified patterns while shipping fast
5. **Building in public with technical users** — developers will scrutinize every interaction; "good enough" won't cut it

## Gaps to Address Honestly

**Requirements you don't directly show:**

- **No dedicated CLI or IDE design portfolio work**
  - **Transferable:** You use terminal workflows daily (Claude Code, Git, npm) and designed AI-assisted dev tools, but haven't shipped a pure CLI/IDE product
  - **Honest framing:** "My Claude Code experience is as a power user designing AI workflows, not as a CLI designer. I'd lean heavily on the team's existing patterns while I build domain fluency in the first 30-60 days."

- **Limited open source portfolio**
  - **Transferable:** Your portfolio site is open source (https://github.com/chadwd), and you've shipped code to production repos, but no major OSS contributions
  - **Honest framing:** "I don't have a deep open source contribution history. My code contributions have been internal (ACV repos, Rand McNally projects). I'd be learning from the team's OSS collaboration norms."

- **No shipped IDE extensions**
  - **Transferable:** You understand multi-surface consistency challenges (coordinated MAX/ClearCar across web/mobile) and have designed for developer handoff tools
  - **Honest framing:** "I haven't designed VS Code or JetBrains extensions. I'd rely on your existing IDE extension patterns and focus on cross-surface consistency—that's where my platform design experience transfers directly."

**Level expectations:**
- Role emphasizes "ambiguity" and "empirical science" culture — you excel here (stabilized CEO-level NCP initiative, navigated team instability with zero roadmap slips)
- "25% in-office" requirement — Seattle location works perfectly; you're already in the area and open to hybrid

**Cultural fit signals you DO have:**
- ✅ Comfort with rapid iteration and evolving specs (designed alongside AI model improvements at ACV)
- ✅ "Single cohesive team" collaboration (cross-functional leadership with Product, Eng, Research)
- ✅ Emphasis on craft details (dev-ready specs, information density, error handling rigor)
- ✅ Building in public mindset (documented prompting patterns, shared enablement artifacts)

## Your Narrative Arc

**Opening hook (pick one based on conversation flow):**

1. **If they lead with AI/agentic workflows:** "I've been designing AI UX patterns in production for the past year—including using Claude Code itself to reduce our design-to-dev cycle by 70%. I'm not coming to this theoretically; I've shipped trust-building patterns for long inference waits, reframed AI output from prescriptive to judgment-supporting, and established code generation as a design artifact."

2. **If they lead with developer tools:** "I'm a designer who ships code to production and uses terminal workflows daily. I reduced handoff iterations from 3-5 cycles to 1 by generating PR-ready code that senior engineering reviews as an official design artifact. I understand dev tool users because I am one."

3. **If they lead with multi-surface complexity:** "I've coordinated design consistency across fragmented product surfaces before—leading a 10+ person cross-product forum to align shared components and migration paths. I know how to build cohesive experiences when teams are moving fast across multiple platforms."

**Core positioning:**
You're hiring for someone who can invent agentic AI UX patterns that don't exist yet, across terminal/IDE/web/Slack, while keeping pace with rapid model evolution. I've already done this at ACV: designed AI workflows using Claude Code itself, shipped trust-building patterns for autonomous operations, and established code prototyping as standard practice. My gap is pure CLI/IDE portfolio work, but my strength is AI UX invention + dev tool fluency + shipping at speed.

**Differentiator:**
Most designers theorize about AI UX. I've shipped production AI patterns (loading states, recommendation framing, code generation workflows) and used Claude Code as a power user to accelerate my own design-to-dev pipeline. I'm designing the tool I already rely on—that user empathy is rare.

## Talking Points Summary

**Lead with these 3 in conversation:**

1. **AI UX at production scale:** "I reduced design-to-dev time 70% using Claude Code + Figma MCP, and shipped trust-building loading states that beat 90% industry abandonment—I'm already designing AI workflows in the wild."

2. **Dev tool fluency through practice:** "I ship PR-ready code as a design artifact, validated by senior engineering. I use terminal workflows daily and understand LLM constraints from hands-on experience, not documentation."

3. **Inventing patterns under ambiguity:** "I stabilized a CEO-level initiative with 88.7% retention by introducing phased sequencing models when requirements were unclear—I thrive when specs are evolving, not fixed."

**Address gaps proactively:**

- **On CLI/IDE experience:** "I haven't shipped a pure CLI or IDE extension, but I've used Claude Code as a power user and designed multi-surface consistency for fragmented platforms. I'd lean on your team's existing patterns while I build domain fluency in the first 60 days."

- **On open source:** "My code contributions have been internal to ACV and Rand McNally repos. I don't have deep OSS history, but I've documented prompting patterns and built enablement artifacts—I understand building in public, just not on GitHub at scale."

**Questions to ask them:**

1. **"How are you balancing consistency across terminal, IDE, web, and Slack as model capabilities evolve weekly?"** (Shows you understand their core tension: multi-surface cohesion + rapid iteration)

2. **"What's the current split between designing new agentic patterns vs. refining existing ones based on user feedback?"** (Shows strategic thinking about invention vs. optimization)

3. **"How does the design team collaborate with research when model capabilities change—do you embed in experiments, or react to shipped features?"** (Shows understanding of AI research culture and design's role in it)

4. **"Claude Code hit $1B ARR in 6 months—what are the biggest UX friction points you're seeing at that scale?"** (Shows you're thinking about growth-stage challenges, not just invention)

## Next Steps

1. **Review each match above** — verify the "why this matters" reasoning aligns with your understanding of their needs
2. **Prepare your Claude Code user story** — they'll want to hear about your hands-on experience; be ready with specifics (what you built, what worked, what frustrated you)
3. **Memorize talking points** for phone screen — lead with AI UX production work, address CLI gap proactively
4. **Prepare honest responses** for:
   - "Show us your CLI/IDE design work" → Redirect to multi-surface platform design + Claude Code power user experience
   - "What's in your GitHub?" → Portfolio site repo + internal code contributions at ACV
   - "How do you prototype?" → Code (HTML/CSS/JS) + Figma for high-fidelity validation

**Salary note:** $260K-$305K range aligns well with your principal-level scope and Seattle market. Your current ACV work (AI workflows, enterprise platform ownership, cross-functional leadership) justifies the higher end of this band.

**Portfolio focus:** Highlight Project N.E.X.T. (AI workflow acceleration), Long Loading State (AI trust UX), and NCP (enterprise platform complexity). These three map directly to their needs: agentic AI patterns, multi-surface design, and craft rigor.

---

**Final assessment:** This is a strong match. Your AI UX work is highly relevant, your dev tool fluency is proven, and your comfort with ambiguity fits their culture. The CLI/IDE gap is real but addressable—you're a power user of the tool you'd be designing, which gives you user empathy most candidates won't have. Lead with that.

**Note:** This is analysis only. You decide which accomplishments to emphasize and how.
