## The Problem They're Solving

Anthropic needs a designer who can invent interaction patterns for agentic AI workflows that sophisticated developers will trust. Claude Code generated $1B+ in annualized revenue within 6 months, and they need someone who can design across terminal, IDE, web, and Slack while the product evolves rapidly with new model capabilities.

**Their biggest pain points:**
1. **Undefined interaction patterns**: Designing "genuinely new territory" - how AI communicates progress, handles multi-step autonomous work, and builds developer trust
2. **Speed and ambiguity**: Keeping pace with constant model capability releases, requiring fast iteration without rigid design processes
3. **Developer-first craft**: Creating terminal/CLI experiences with high information density, keyboard-first interaction, and minimal friction for sophisticated users
4. **Code-native design**: Need someone who can prototype functional CLI/terminal interfaces directly, not just push pixels

## Gaps to Address Honestly

**Requirements you don't directly show:**

- **Native CLI/terminal interface design**
  - **Transferable:** You've designed workflows that *generate* terminal-executable code (Figma MCP → Claude Code), and work daily with terminal-based dev tools (HTML, CSS, SCSS, GitHub workflows). You understand developer mental models.
  - **Honest framing:** "My design portfolio doesn't show CLI mockups because I've been designing AI workflows that output to CLIs, not designing the CLI itself. But I use terminal tools daily (git, npm, Claude Code) and understand keyboard-first, information-dense interfaces."

- **Open source contributions or public GitHub profile**
  - **Transferable:** Project N.E.X.T. created documented prompting patterns and workflows that could be open-sourced (internal documentation currently private).
  - **Honest framing:** "My GitHub profile is sparse—most work is enterprise-internal. But I'm open to contributing design patterns for Claude Code's interaction model if the team values public artifacts."

- **IDE extension design (VSCode, IntelliJ, etc.)**
  - **Transferable:** Design systems work shows multi-surface pattern consistency (web, mobile, tools). Understanding of plugin architectures from Figma plugin workflows.
  - **Honest framing:** "I haven't designed IDE extensions specifically, but I've designed consistent patterns across multiple surfaces (MAX, ClearCar, Retail, NCP) and understand how developers context-switch between tools."

**Level expectations:**

- **Role framed as specialized/expert** but doesn't specify "Staff" or "Principal" explicitly
  - Your profile shows **principal-level scope**: CEO-level platform ownership, design system governance, cross-org influence, and sustained high-volume execution
  - The $260K-$305K range suggests mid-to-senior level, which aligns well
  - **Potential concern:** Your title is "Product Designer" (with principal-level scope noted), not official "Principal Designer"—be ready to clarify scope vs. title

## Your Narrative Arc

**Opening hook (pick one based on their biggest pain):**

1. **If they emphasize AI interaction pattern invention:**
   "I've been designing AI agent workflows with Claude Code for the past year—not just using it, but inventing trust-building patterns for 10-60 second inference delays that outperform industry abandonment rates. I'm applying to help you make those patterns even better."

2. **If they emphasize developer tool craft:**
   "I reduced design-to-dev cycle time from 20-45 days to 2-4 days by building AI-assisted workflows with Figma MCP and Claude Code. Now I want to help you design the tools that make that possible for every developer."

3. **If they emphasize fast iteration and ambiguity:**
   "I've shipped 155 UX initiatives this year across 4 product lines while leading a CEO-level platform under constant change. I thrive in environments where model capabilities ship weekly and rigid processes don't work."

**Core positioning:**
You're a principal-level product designer who's already solved the core challenge Anthropic is hiring for: designing AI agent workflows that developers trust. You've used Claude Code to ship production work, understand LLM capabilities and limitations from hands-on experience, and have proven you can invent interaction patterns for genuinely new territory (AI loading states, multi-step agentic workflows). You're not learning on the job—you're bringing battle-tested patterns from enterprise AI product design.

**Differentiator:**
Most designers applying will have "used ChatGPT" or "designed AI features." You've **shipped production AI UX at scale** (enterprise platform with 88.7% retention), **built workflows using their own product** (Claude Code + Figma MCP), and **designed trust-building patterns for the hardest UX challenge in AI** (keeping users engaged during unpredictable 10-60 second waits). You're not theoretical—you're empirical.
