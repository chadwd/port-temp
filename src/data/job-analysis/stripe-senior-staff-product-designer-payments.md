## The Problem They're Solving

Stripe needs a design leader who can own the Payments Dashboard end-to-end, creating advanced configuration experiences for merchants that minimize code while maximizing power. They're building a new dashboard primitive and AI-driven workflows, and need someone who can elevate craft across multiple teams.

**Their biggest pain points:**

1. **Horizontal complexity** — Payments spans multiple organizations; they need someone who can articulate compelling vision across teams and manage stakeholders at high levels
2. **B2B with consumer polish** — They explicitly want "consumer design sensibilities" in complex B2B workflows—this is rare and hard to find
3. **Design leadership without management** — They need a senior IC who multiplies other designers, leads workstreams, and sets quality bars—not just ships their own work
4. **New primitives + AI** — Building foundational dashboard elements AND designing AI-driven merchant experiences requires systems thinking + innovation

## Gaps to Address Honestly

**Requirements you don't directly show:**

- **Pure fintech/payments domain experience**
  - **Transferable:** Automotive SaaS with complex pricing, compliance, and financial configuration is structurally similar. Personal fintech/crypto experience (50-100+ DeFi transactions, TradingView technical analysis) provides user empathy for financial workflows.
  - **Honest framing:** "My professional experience is automotive B2B, not payments directly. But the core challenge—making complex financial configuration intuitive for business operators—is the same. I also trade and use DeFi personally, so I understand the user mindset."

- **Stripe-specific product familiarity**
  - **Transferable:** You understand dashboard configuration patterns, API-driven experiences, and no-code tooling concepts from NCP work.
  - **Honest framing:** "I'd need ramp-up time on Stripe's specific product landscape, but I learn complex domains quickly—as evidenced by becoming the NCP expert within months."

- **"Impeccable visual design" portfolio proof**
  - **Gap:** Your portfolio may lean process/systems rather than pure visual craft showcase. Stripe explicitly calls this out.
  - **Honest framing:** "My work prioritizes functional elegance over decorative polish, but I can show how loading states, component systems, and interaction details demonstrate high craft in context."

**Level expectations:**

- **15+ years requirement** — You have ~15 years (2009 graduation + Rand McNally + ACV), but tenure at current company (7+ years at one place) may need framing.
  - **Honest framing:** "Long tenure at ACV reflects sustained impact and growth from IC to principal-level scope—not stagnation. I've had multiple 'jobs' within the same company across platforms, products, and teams."

## Your Narrative Arc

**Opening hook (pick one based on their biggest pain):**

1. **If they emphasize AI workflows:** "I've shipped AI-assisted design workflows that cut cycle time from 45 days to 4—not prototypes, production systems. I'm looking to apply that at Stripe's scale."

2. **If they emphasize horizontal complexity:** "I've led design across 4 product lines simultaneously during organizational instability with zero roadmap slips. Horizontal coordination is my operating mode."

3. **If they emphasize consumer craft in B2B:** "I obsess over details most B2B designers ignore—like turning a 60-second AI wait into a trust-building moment that outperformed 90% of industry abandonment rates."

**Core positioning:**

Principal-level enterprise designer who brings systems thinking and consumer-grade craft to complex B2B platforms. At ACV, I've owned CEO-level initiatives end-to-end, built AI workflows from concept to production, and multiplied team impact through design systems and operational clarity. I'm looking for a company where the problems are harder and the bar is higher—Stripe's Payments Dashboard is exactly that.

**Differentiator:**

The rare combination of AI workflow innovation (shipped, not theoretical) + enterprise platform ownership (CEO-level stakes) + design systems leadership (200% engagement growth) + consumer-level craft obsession (90th percentile trust metrics). Most candidates have one or two of these. I have all four, proven at scale.

## Talking Points Summary

**Lead with these 3 in conversation:**

1. "I reduced design-to-dev cycle time from 45 days to 4 using AI-assisted workflows I built myself—directly relevant to Stripe's AI merchant experience goals."

2. "I led UX for a CEO-level pricing platform that achieved 88.7% retention and onboarded 210 new customers—the exact stakes and complexity of Payments Dashboard."

3. "I've multiplied designer impact without being a manager—200% DS engagement growth, cross-product coordination forums, and quality bars that elevated entire teams."

**Address gaps proactively:**

- "My domain is automotive B2B, not payments—but complex pricing configuration and compliance is structurally identical. I also trade crypto personally, so I understand financial user mindsets."

- "Long tenure at ACV might look like limited exposure, but I've essentially had 4 different jobs there—spanning platforms, AI, design systems, and enterprise products."

**Questions to ask them:**

- "You mention building a new dashboard primitive—what's the current constraint you're solving? Is it technical flexibility, user comprehension, or both?"

- "How does the Payments design team currently balance craft consistency across multiple product areas? Is there an existing system, or is that part of what you're looking for this person to build?"

- "What does success look like for AI-driven merchant workflows in the first year? Are you optimizing for adoption, revenue impact, or operational efficiency?"
