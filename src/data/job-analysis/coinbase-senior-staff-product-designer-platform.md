## The Problem They're Solving

Coinbase needs a senior staff designer who can operate at the center of execution across their entire product ecosystem—bridging consumer onboarding flows with advanced crypto trader needs, while maintaining consistency and quality at scale through design systems thinking.

**Their biggest pain points:**

1. **Cross-product consistency at scale** - Building for both crypto novices and experts across multiple product areas requires scalable patterns and systems thinking, not one-off solutions
2. **Platform-level strategic influence** - They need someone who can shape product vision and strategy across the company, not just execute within a single product team
3. **Design system maturity** - Creating reusable patterns and components that drive efficiency across all Coinbase products while maintaining brand expression and quality
4. **Emerging technology adoption** - Experimenting with AI tools to accelerate design workflows while maintaining craft standards in a high-intensity culture

## Gaps to Address Honestly

**Requirements you don't directly show:**

- **Crypto/FinTech domain experience** (listed as "nice to have")
  - **Transferable:** Your enterprise B2B SaaS experience (wholesale auto marketplace) shares core challenges with crypto platforms: complex financial transactions, compliance constraints, trust-building for unfamiliar technology, and serving both novice and expert users
  - **Honest framing:** "I lack direct crypto experience, but I've designed enterprise financial platforms where trust, compliance, and complexity are table stakes. The pattern of making unfamiliar technology accessible to users (AI inference, wholesale auctions) transfers directly to crypto onboarding."

- **Mobile-first consumer product design**
  - **Transferable:** Your work spans web and mobile enterprise workflows, but your portfolio showcases more web/desktop complexity than mobile-first consumer experiences
  - **Honest framing:** "Most of my work has been enterprise web platforms with mobile components. I'm strongest in complex workflow design and systems thinking, which applies to Coinbase's platform scope—though I acknowledge their consumer mobile flows may be less familiar territory for me initially."

- **Thought leadership in crypto/Web3**
  - **Gap:** This is a genuine mismatch. Their success criteria includes "Becoming a thought leader in crypto and Web3"
  - **Honest framing:** "I'm not currently a crypto thought leader and wouldn't claim expertise in Web3. What I bring is proven ability to become a domain expert quickly (I learned automotive wholesale, healthcare data, AI workflows) and a track record of pushing boundaries in emerging technology (AI tools, design-to-code acceleration). I'd need to invest heavily in crypto education, but I have the pattern of deep domain learning."

**Level expectations:**

- **Senior Staff scope clarity:** Your profile demonstrates principal-level platform leadership, but Coinbase's "Senior Staff" title may have different scope expectations than your current principal-level work. Their role emphasizes "spanning multiple product areas" and "influencing stakeholders across the company"—which you've done—but it's worth clarifying their specific definition of Senior Staff vs. Staff vs. Principal in conversation.

- **Mentorship visibility:** The posting mentions "mentoring other designers" as a thought leader. Your profile shows process ownership and enablement artifacts, but formal mentorship examples are limited. Consider highlighting specific designers you've coached if this comes up in interviews.

## Your Narrative Arc

**Opening hook (pick one based on their biggest pain):**

1. **If they emphasize AI/innovation:** "I reduced our design-to-code cycle from 20-45 days to 2-4 days using AI-assisted workflows—exactly the kind of emerging tool experimentation Coinbase is calling for in this role."

2. **If they emphasize platform/systems thinking:** "I've built design systems that scale across product lines and customer segments—from governance frameworks to componentized pricing logic that enables white-labeling. That's the systems thinking you need when designing for both crypto beginners and advanced traders."

3. **If they emphasize cross-functional influence:** "I led UX for a CEO-level enterprise initiative that achieved 88.7% retention under intense scrutiny. I know what it takes to operate at the center of company-wide execution with stakeholders at every level."

**Core positioning:**

You need a senior staff designer who can scale Coinbase's platform through systems, not just execution. I bring 15+ years of platform and design systems leadership, with a track record of operating at principal-level scope across multiple product areas. I don't just ship features—I architect scalable patterns, establish governance that teams actually adopt, and drive strategic influence across Product, Engineering, and Research. My AI workflow innovation shows I'm pushing boundaries in emerging tech, which aligns with Coinbase's mission to build the future of finance.

**Differentiator:**

Principal-level design systems work + AI workflow innovation in enterprise B2B products most designers never touch. I've proven I can make complex, unfamiliar technology trustworthy (AI inference, wholesale auctions, enterprise pricing)—the exact challenge of crypto onboarding. I scale through systems and process ownership, not heroics.

## Talking Points Summary

**Lead with these 3 in conversation:**

1. **Design systems as business enabler** - "I established sustainable DS operations with KPIs tied to business value, not just component counts—reducing pixel drift and handoff cycles across enterprise surfaces."

2. **AI workflow innovation with measurable impact** - "I 10x'd our design-to-dev cycle time using Figma MCP and Claude Code, with documented patterns that teams can adopt—this is the AI experimentation Coinbase wants at senior staff level."

3. **Platform-level strategic execution** - "I led UX for a CEO-level initiative spanning multiple product teams, achieving 88.7% retention under intense pressure—I know how to operate at the center of company-wide execution."

**Address gaps proactively:**

- **Crypto experience:** "I don't have crypto domain expertise, but I've designed financial platforms where trust, compliance, and complexity are non-negotiable. I have a pattern of becoming a domain expert quickly—I learned automotive wholesale, healthcare data, and AI workflows from scratch."

- **Thought leadership:** "I'm not a crypto thought leader today. What I bring is a track record of pushing boundaries in emerging tech (AI tools, design-to-code acceleration) and establishing best practices that teams adopt. I'd invest heavily in crypto education to build that expertise."

**Questions to ask them:**

- "How do you define Senior Staff scope here versus Staff or Principal? I've operated at principal-level platform leadership—want to make sure I understand how that maps to your career ladder."

- "What's the biggest gap in your design system maturity today? Is it governance, adoption, component coverage, or something else? I've built the 'Purpose, Process, Profit' framework to address exactly this."

- "How are you currently experimenting with AI tools across the design team? Are you looking for someone to establish best practices, or is this more exploratory for now?"
