## The Problem They're Solving

Coinbase Platform Design needs a senior IC who can execute complex, cross-company design initiatives while elevating platform-wide quality through systems thinking. They're building infrastructure that powers all Coinbase products—not a feature team, but the foundation layer. The role requires someone who can navigate ambiguity, influence without authority, and ship scalable patterns that other teams adopt.

**Their biggest pain points:**
1. **Cross-product complexity** — Design initiatives span multiple product areas requiring strategic alignment and coordination across the company
2. **Scale and consistency** — Need reusable patterns and components that drive efficiency across all Coinbase products (not one-off solutions)
3. **Platform-level influence** — Sr. Staff level means shaping product vision and strategy, not just executing tickets
4. **AI workflow adoption** — Explicitly seeking someone experimenting with AI tools for prototyping and design acceleration

## Gaps to Address Honestly

**Requirements you don't directly show:**

### 1. Consumer-Facing Product Design (10+ years)
- **The gap:** Your portfolio emphasizes B2B/enterprise (ACV dealers, Rand McNally education) rather than consumer-facing products. Coinbase explicitly wants "consumer-facing products for web and mobile."
- **Transferable:** Dealer-facing tools (MAX, ClearCar) serve small business owners who behave like consumers—they expect intuitive mobile experiences, not enterprise complexity. WorldAtlas was consumer-grade education software.
- **Honest framing:** "My experience is primarily B2B, but the users I design for—car dealers, teachers, small business owners—expect consumer-grade simplicity. I've never had the luxury of enterprise-style training wheels."

### 2. Professional FinTech/Crypto Design Experience
- **The gap:** No professional crypto/fintech design work on resume. Personal experience doesn't equal portfolio work.
- **Transferable:** Personal hands-on DeFi/trading experience provides genuine user empathy. Enterprise platform complexity (compliance, multi-stakeholder workflows) translates to financial product rigor.
- **Honest framing:** "I don't have professional crypto design experience—but I've been a crypto user since [year], navigating the UX pain points firsthand. I know what breaks because I've experienced the failures as a user."

### 3. Visual Design Portfolio Strength
- **The gap:** Coinbase emphasizes "excellence in UX thinking, visual design, and written communication." Your profile emphasizes systems, process, and outcomes—less visual craft.
- **Transferable:** Design systems work requires visual rigor (tokens, component specs). Portfolio can showcase this.
- **Honest framing:** "My visual design work lives in systems—tokens, components, scalable patterns. I'm not a dribbble-style visual designer, but I can show craft through systematic consistency."

**Level expectations:**
- **Sr. Staff scope alignment:** Your accomplishments show principal-level scope (cross-team influence, strategic initiatives, system architecture). This aligns well with Sr. Staff expectations.
- **"Thought leader" expectation:** The role wants someone who becomes "a thought leader in crypto and Web3." This is a growth area—you'd be learning the domain while contributing platform expertise.

## Your Narrative Arc

**Opening hook (pick one based on interviewer focus):**

1. **If they emphasize AI/innovation:**
   "I reduced our design-to-dev cycle from 30-60 days to 10-15 days by operationalizing AI workflows—not experimenting, but shipping production code with documented patterns. I'm looking for a company where that kind of ambition is the baseline, not the exception."

2. **If they emphasize platform/systems:**
   "I unified 6+ fragmented product design systems into a federated architecture that grew team contribution 200%. Platform work is invisible when it works—I've made a career of the infrastructure that makes other teams successful."

3. **If they emphasize culture/intensity:**
   "I delivered 155 UX initiatives last year—highest on the team—while absorbing research responsibilities during team instability. Coinbase's 'intense culture' description reads like my normal operating mode."

**Core positioning:**

You're a platform systems designer who's already operationalized AI workflows at scale. While other candidates bring crypto curiosity, you bring proven infrastructure for AI-accelerated design and cross-product systems thinking. Your B2B experience taught you to design for users who expect consumer simplicity but operate in enterprise complexity—exactly the challenge of making crypto accessible to millions while serving sophisticated traders.

**Differentiator:**

"I'm the designer who ships code. My AI workflow produces PR-ready components that engineering reviews as official artifacts—not mockups that need translation. For a Platform team building infrastructure, that's the difference between months and weeks."

## Talking Points Summary

**Lead with these 3 in conversation:**
1. **AI acceleration is production-ready:** "I reduced design-to-dev cycle 70% with AI workflows that shipped PR-ready code—not experiments, but documented patterns your Platform team could adopt."
2. **Systems unification at scale:** "I unified 6+ fragmented design systems into federated architecture with 200% contribution growth—exactly what Platform teams need for cross-company consistency."
3. **Reliability under pressure:** "155 UX initiatives, highest team output, zero roadmap slips during instability—I thrive in intense environments, not despite them."

**Address gaps proactively:**
- **Consumer experience:** "My B2B users—small business owners, car dealers—expect consumer-grade UX. I've never designed with enterprise training wheels."
- **Crypto domain:** "I'm a crypto user, not just a crypto-curious designer. I've navigated DeFi friction, failed transactions, and gas optimization firsthand—that user empathy can't be taught."
- **Visual portfolio:** "My visual design lives in systems—tokens, components, scalable patterns. I show craft through consistency, not one-off illustrations."

**Questions to ask them:**
- "How does the Platform team balance creating reusable infrastructure vs. shipping product-specific solutions? What's the current tension?"
- "What's blocked previous AI workflow adoption in design? Is it tooling, process, or cultural?"
- "The role mentions 'thought leadership in Web3'—what does that look like for a Platform designer vs. a product designer?"
