## Gaps to Address Honestly

**Requirements you don't directly show:**

- **Domain expertise in healthcare, financial services, or education**
  - **Transferable:** Your NCP work involved regulated compliance (automotive pricing), complex multi-stakeholder logic (dealers, OEMs, regulators), and auditability requirements—core challenges in healthcare/fintech.
  - **Honest framing:** "My enterprise platform experience is in automotive B2B (not healthcare/finance/education), but the core challenges—compliance, auditability, multi-stakeholder workflows, and trust in complex systems—are directly transferable. I've built deep domain expertise before (automotive pricing in 8 months) and can do it again."

- **Consumer/B2C product experience**
  - **Gap:** Your experience is almost entirely enterprise B2B. Anthropic serves both enterprise and consumer (claude.ai).
  - **Honest framing:** "My background is B2B/enterprise SaaS, not consumer products. I understand this is a gap for consumer-facing Claude experiences, but enterprise adoption (the role focus) is my strength."

- **Startup environment experience at Anthropic's scale**
  - **Transferable:** You've worked through organizational chaos (team instability, absorbing research), but ACV Auctions (~1000+ employees) is larger than Anthropic (~300).
  - **Honest framing:** "ACV is larger than Anthropic, but I've navigated startup-like ambiguity (team changes, rapid pivots, CEO-level initiatives). The 'builder mindset' is there, proven by Project N.E.X.T. and my operational clarity systems."

**Level expectations:**
- **Senior/Staff match:** The 8+ year requirement and "end-to-end execution" align with your principal-level scope at ACV. Your accomplishments show staff+ impact (cross-team influence, DS governance, CEO-level projects). **No gap here.**

## Your Narrative Arc

**Opening hook (pick one based on their biggest pain):**

1. **If they emphasize AI trust/adoption barriers (RECOMMENDED):**
   "I've designed AI trust-building UX that outperformed the 90% industry abandonment baseline during long inference delays, and I've accelerated design-to-code workflows using Claude Code itself—so I understand AI products both as a designer and a builder."

2. **If they emphasize enterprise platform scaling:**
   "I've stabilized a CEO-level enterprise platform with 88.7% retention across 210+ organizations by translating complex regulated workflows into scalable, self-serve UX—exactly the challenge Anthropic faces rolling out Claude to large enterprises."

3. **If they emphasize rapid prototyping/technical collaboration:**
   "I reduced design-to-dev cycle time from 20-45 days to 2-4 days using Figma MCP and Claude Code, proving I can prototype with code, partner tightly with engineering, and innovate on interaction design frontiers."

**Core positioning:**

You need someone who can make Claude feel like a trusted collaborator for enterprise teams navigating unfamiliar AI territory. I've spent the last two years solving that exact problem: designing trust-building AI UX, building with AI tools (Claude Code + Figma MCP), and scaling enterprise platforms in regulated environments. My automotive domain differs from healthcare/finance/education, but the core challenges—compliance, auditability, multi-stakeholder complexity, and building trust in ambiguous systems—are identical.

**Differentiator:**

Principal-level AI product designer who doesn't just design AI products—I build my workflows WITH AI tools (Claude Code, Figma MCP). I understand LLMs from both sides: as a designer solving trust/adoption problems, and as a practitioner using Claude daily to accelerate design-to-code handoffs. Most designers talk about AI; I ship with it.

## Talking Points Summary

**Lead with these 3 in conversation:**

1. **AI trust UX:** "I designed loading states for 10-60 second AI inference delays that outperformed the 90% abandonment baseline—making ambiguous AI processes feel transparent and trustworthy."

2. **AI workflow acceleration:** "I reduced design-to-dev time from 20-45 days to 2-4 days using Claude Code and Figma MCP, so I understand LLMs both as a design subject and a daily tool."

3. **Enterprise platform ownership:** "I stabilized a CEO-level pricing platform with 88.7% retention across regulated compliance workflows—similar complexity to rolling out Claude in healthcare/finance."

**Address gaps proactively:**

- **Domain gap:** "My enterprise experience is automotive B2B, not healthcare/finance/education. But I've built deep domain expertise before (automotive pricing in 8 months), and the core challenges—compliance, multi-stakeholder logic, auditability—are transferable. I learn domains fast."

- **Consumer gap:** "My background is B2B/enterprise, not consumer products. I understand this role focuses on enterprise adoption, which is my strength, but I'm aware Claude serves both audiences."

**Questions to ask them:**

- "What's the biggest adoption barrier you're seeing with enterprise customers trying to roll out Claude to large teams? Is it trust/transparency, tooling/governance, or domain-specific compliance?"

- "How do you balance designing self-serve experiences for enterprise admins versus end-users who might not understand LLM capabilities and limitations?"

- "What does 'building domain expertise' look like in practice for this role? Are you embedding designers with customers, running research sprints, or something else?"
