## The Problem They're Solving

Coinbase Advanced Trade needs a designer who understands professional trading deeply—not just UX patterns, but the mental models of traders navigating order types, market analysis, and liquidity. They're building tools for users who demand precision, speed, and power, not consumer simplicity. The role requires someone who can ship in a fast-paced environment while handling the complexity of financial data visualization.

**Their biggest pain points:**
1. **Trading domain expertise** — They explicitly want "personal or professional experience with trading platforms" and understanding of "advanced trading concepts like order types, market analysis, and liquidity pools"
2. **Data-dense, precision UX** — Advanced traders need complex data presented with sharp attention to detail, not dumbed-down consumer flows
3. **Fast-paced execution** — Staff-level ownership of end-to-end design in an intense, sometimes ambiguous environment
4. **Cross-functional collaboration** — Working with product, research, marketing, and engineering to ship globally

## Your Direct Value

These accomplishments from your profile directly address their needs:

### 1. Personal Crypto/DeFi Trading Experience (Their #1 Differentiator)

**Their need:** "Personal or professional experience with trading platforms, including a deep understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities" + "Knowledge of advanced trading concepts like order types, market analysis, and liquidity pools"

**Your proof:**
> Executed **50-100+ token swaps** across Uniswap, Crypto.com DeFi, Base, and VVS with multi-chain navigation. Applied **7+ technical indicators** (Gaussian Channel, MACD, Stoch RSI, RSI, Fibonacci Retracements) plus custom Moving Average scripts in TradingView for crypto and stock market analysis.

**Why this matters:** You're not a designer who "finds crypto interesting"—you've navigated the friction, gas fees, slippage, and failed transactions that advanced traders experience daily. You know what breaks because you've felt it break.

## Gaps to Address Honestly

**Requirements you don't directly show:**

### 1. Professional Trading Platform Design Experience
- **The gap:** Your crypto/trading experience is personal, not professional. No portfolio work on trading interfaces, order books, or charting tools.
- **Transferable:** New Car Pricing is professional financial tooling with pricing logic, compliance, and data-dense workflows. The core challenge—helping professionals make financial decisions with complex data—is transferable.
- **Honest framing:** "My professional work is enterprise financial platforms, not trading interfaces. But I've designed data-dense pricing tools for professionals making high-stakes decisions—and I've used trading platforms personally enough to know where they break."

### 2. Consumer/Retail Product Design
- **The gap:** Your portfolio is B2B/enterprise. Advanced Trade serves "advanced traders globally"—a mix of retail and professional.
- **Transferable:** Advanced traders behave more like professionals than casual consumers. Your enterprise precision may actually be a better fit than consumer-focused designers.
- **Honest framing:** "I design for professionals who demand precision, not consumer simplicity. Advanced traders are closer to my enterprise users than to retail crypto buyers—they want power tools, not hand-holding."

### 3. 0-to-1 Product Launch Experience
- **The gap:** Your experience is more "scale and transform" than "0-to-1." No clear greenfield product launches in portfolio.
- **Transferable:** Project N.E.X.T. (AI workflow) was essentially 0-to-1—new capability with no existing patterns. Appraisal Alerts was a new feature built from research.
- **Honest framing:** "Most of my work is scaling and transforming existing products. My 0-to-1 experience is features within platforms (Alerts, AI workflows), not standalone products."

### 4. Mobile Trading Experience
- **The gap:** Role mentions "web and mobile experiences." Your portfolio emphasizes web/desktop enterprise tools.
- **Transferable:** ClearCar mobile workflows (Take Into Inventory) show mobile design experience, just not trading-specific.
- **Honest framing:** "My mobile experience is enterprise workflows, not trading. I'd need to learn mobile trading conventions, but I understand mobile constraints from ClearCar work."

**Level expectations:**
- **Staff-level alignment:** Your accomplishments show principal-level scope at current company. Staff at Coinbase is a step down in title but comparable in expectations—this is well-matched.
- **Autonomy:** "Work autonomously" is explicitly stated. Your track record of maintaining output during team instability demonstrates this.

## Your Narrative Arc

**Opening hook (pick one based on interviewer focus):**

1. **If they emphasize trading domain:**
   "I've executed 50-100+ token swaps across Uniswap, Base, and VVS, run technical analysis in TradingView with 7+ indicators, and participated in 5 ICOs. I know what breaks in trading UX because I've felt it break as a user."

2. **If they emphasize execution/intensity:**
   "155 UX initiatives shipped last year—highest on my team—with zero roadmap slips during team instability. Coinbase's 'intense culture' description reads like my normal operating mode."

3. **If they emphasize craft/complexity:**
   "I've designed data-dense financial platforms where every pixel affects professional decisions—pricing logic, compliance constraints, multi-stakeholder workflows. Trading interfaces are a new domain, but precision UX for high-stakes professionals is not."

**Core positioning:**

You're a designer with genuine crypto user expertise who's been designing data-dense financial platforms for professionals. Unlike designers who "find crypto interesting," you've navigated the DeFi ecosystem firsthand—gas optimization, failed transactions, multi-chain complexity. You bring enterprise platform rigor (88.7% retention, 155 initiatives shipped) to a domain you actually use. The gap is professional trading interface experience; the bridge is your combination of personal trading fluency and professional financial platform design.

**Differentiator:**

"I've used the competition. I know where Binance, Uniswap, and Crypto.com DeFi break from personal experience—not user research, but frustration. That's user empathy you can't fake."

## Talking Points Summary

**Lead with these 3 in conversation:**
1. **Crypto user, not crypto curious:** "50-100+ swaps across 4 DeFi platforms, 7+ TradingView indicators, 5 ICOs. I know advanced trading UX from the inside."
2. **Data-dense financial platforms:** "88.7% retention on enterprise pricing platform with complex rebate logic and multi-stakeholder workflows. Precision UX for professionals is my specialty."
3. **Intensity-compatible:** "155 initiatives, highest team output, zero slips during instability. Your culture description matches how I already work."

**Address gaps proactively:**
- **No professional trading design:** "My portfolio is enterprise financial platforms, not trading. But I've designed for professionals making high-stakes decisions with complex data—and I've used trading platforms enough to know where they fail."
- **B2B focus:** "I design for professionals who demand precision. Advanced traders are closer to my enterprise users than to retail crypto buyers—they want power, not simplicity."
- **Mobile trading:** "My mobile experience is enterprise workflows, not trading. I'd learn mobile trading conventions, but I understand mobile constraints."

**Questions to ask them:**
- "What's the biggest UX friction advanced traders hit today that you haven't solved? Order execution? Portfolio visibility? Something else?"
- "How does the Advanced Trade team balance power-user complexity with preventing costly mistakes? Where's the current tension?"
- "What distinguishes Coinbase Advanced from competitors like Binance Pro in your view—and where do you want to differentiate further?"
