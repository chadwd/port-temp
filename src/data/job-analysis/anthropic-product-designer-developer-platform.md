## The Problem They're Solving

Anthropic needs a designer to make their API products (Console, docs, Workbench) frictionless for developers building with Claude. They're scaling from research-first AI company to developer platform business, which means the developer experience is now a revenue-critical surface. The role exists to bridge AI capability with usable tooling—making complex agentic systems accessible without dumbing them down.

**Their biggest pain points:**
1. **Developer friction:** API products need to support new AI capabilities (tools, multi-modal, agents) without overwhelming developers with complexity
2. **Administrative overhead:** Billing, usage management, and org-level controls are likely bolted-on afterthoughts that need proper UX
3. **Ambiguity at scale:** Fast-moving AI research creates constant ambiguity—features ship before patterns are established, requiring designers who can define the rules

## Gaps to Address Honestly

**Requirements you don't directly show:**

- **8+ years product design experience**
  - **Your profile:** 8 years at ACV (2017-current) + 4 years at Rand McNally (2013-2017) = 12 years total. ✅ You meet this.
  - **No gap here.**

- **Documentation design experience**
  - **Transferable:** You've created "Purpose, Process, Profit" DS frameworks, dev handoff checklists, and enablement artifacts—all forms of documentation for technical audiences.
  - **Honest framing:** "My documentation work has been internal-facing (design systems, engineering handoffs) rather than public developer docs, but the core skill—making complex systems clear for technical users—is the same."

- **API-first product design**
  - **Transferable:** New Car Pricing was a componentized platform designed for white-labeling and syndication (API-like thinking). Project N.E.X.T. integrated with Figma MCP (API).
  - **Honest framing:** "I haven't designed Console-style API products, but I've designed platform products with similar power-user needs: configurability, error transparency, and technical depth over simplicity."

**Level expectations:**
- **Principal scope:** The role is listed at "Product Designer" but pays $260-305K (principal range). Your profile shows principal-level scope:
  - Cross-product impact (4 product lines)
  - Process/framework creation (N.E.X.T., DS operations, Jira process)
  - Business outcome ownership (retention, revenue, efficiency)
- **No gap here—you're already operating at this level.**

**Location:**
- **Their requirement:** SF, NYC, or Seattle with 25% in-office minimum
- **Your profile:** Seattle-area hybrid with SF travel quarterly
- **No gap—you're geographically aligned.**

## Your Narrative Arc

**Opening hook (pick one based on their biggest pain):**

1. **If they emphasize AI + developer tooling:** "I've spent the last year designing AI-assisted workflows for developers—my Project N.E.X.T. work reduced design-to-code cycles from 20 days to 2 days. The Console is the next frontier: making Claude accessible to developers building agentic systems."

2. **If they emphasize platform complexity:** "I've designed enterprise platforms where the user is a power user, not a novice—dealers managing pricing logic, devs managing design tokens. The Claude Console is the same problem: technical users who need depth, not simplification."

3. **If they emphasize execution velocity:** "I delivered 155 UX initiatives last year with zero roadmap slips during org chaos. Fast-moving AI research requires that same operational rigor—shipping new capabilities without breaking existing patterns."

**Core positioning:**
You're a principal-level designer who's already solved Anthropic's core design challenge: making AI tools frictionless for technical users building complex systems. You've designed for developers (N.E.X.T.), built trust UX for AI inference delays, and created platform products that balance power-user depth with usability. You bring both the AI-native UX thinking *and* the enterprise platform rigor they need to scale the developer experience.

**Differentiator:**
Most designers with AI experience come from consumer products (ChatGPT, Midjourney). You come from enterprise platforms and *tools for makers*—you understand that developers don't want magic, they want transparency, configurability, and reliability. That's what the Console needs.

## Talking Points Summary

**Lead with these 3 in conversation:**

1. **AI workflow acceleration:** "I reduced design-to-code cycles from 20 days to 2 days by building AI-assisted workflows with Figma MCP and Claude Code—I've already designed *for* developers building with AI."

2. **Trust-building AI UX:** "I outperformed the 90% abandonment baseline during AI inference delays by designing 'thinking' loading states—the Console needs that same trust layer for developers waiting on agentic workflows."

3. **Platform design for power users:** "My enterprise pricing platform retained 88.7% of dealers because it gave them depth and control, not hand-holding—API developers need the same: configurability over simplification."

**Address gaps proactively:**

- **API product design gap:** "I haven't designed Console-style API products, but I've designed platform products with the same power-user needs: New Car Pricing was built for white-labeling and syndication, which required API-like componentization and clear contracts."

- **Public documentation gap:** "My documentation work has been internal (DS frameworks, dev handoffs), not public developer docs, but the skill is transferable—both require making complex systems clear for technical audiences."

**Questions to ask them:**

- **Understanding their problem:** "What's the biggest friction point developers hit when building with the API today—is it capability discovery, error debugging, or something else?"

- **Strategic thinking:** "As you add more agentic capabilities (multi-step tools, long-running workflows), how are you balancing the need for transparency (showing what Claude is doing) with simplicity (not overwhelming developers)?"

- **Team dynamics:** "How does the design team balance research collaboration (new AI capabilities) with product execution (shipping Console features)—is there a formalized handoff, or more embedded partnership?"
