### Phase 6: Deployment
**Goal**: Live site on GitHub Pages with custom domain from GoDaddy
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Research**: Likely (deployment config, DNS setup)
**Research topics**: Astro GitHub Pages adapter, GitHub Actions workflow, GoDaddy DNS configuration for GitHub Pages
**Plans**: TBD
