# Milestone v1.3: Professional Data Infrastructure

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-20
**Phases:** 15, 18
**Total Plans:** 5 plans (Phases 16-17 deferred)

## Overview

Build centralized professional metadata system and agent toolkit for maintaining single source of truth across resumes, CVs, portfolios, and AI assistants. Includes automated resume/CV generation from structured profile data.

**Note:** Phases 16 (Profile Data System) and 17 (Impact Schema Foundation) were deferred. The milestone shipped with Phases 15 and 18, which together provide complete metadata infrastructure and document generation capabilities.

## Phases

### Phase 15: Metadata Schema & Agents

**Goal**: Professional metadata schema + agents for data maintenance and job application support
**Depends on**: v1.2 complete
**Research**: Unlikely (internal schema/skill design)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 15-01: Schema design - profile.yaml, Zod validation, helper functions (completed 2026-01-19)
- [x] 15-02: Profile Updater Agent - source ingestion, XYZ extraction, validation skill (completed 2026-01-20)
- [x] 15-03: Job Matcher Agent - extract relevant accomplishments for job applications (completed 2026-01-20)

**Status**: ✓ Complete (3/3 plans finished)

**Details:**

**15-01: Professional Profile Schema**
- Created `src/data/profile.yaml` as single source of truth
- Implemented Zod validation schema with TypeScript types (`src/data/schema.ts`)
- Built loader utilities with helper functions (`src/data/index.ts`)
- Defined XYZ format (Google Resume Formula): "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]"
- Structured data: identity, contact, summary, strengths, skills, experience, education, certifications, impact statements, impact metrics, projects, leadership
- Added source materials in `src/data/sources/*.md` for reference

**15-02: Profile Updater Agent**
- Created `.claude/skills/profile-updater.md` skill (416 lines)
- Implemented XYZ extraction rules with quality assessment (Strong/Needs Review/Weak)
- Built anti-pattern detection for duty descriptions, vague metrics, and passive voice
- Added schema validation against profile.yaml Zod schema
- Ensured human-in-the-loop: skill proposes only, never auto-edits
- Tested with real source document (2025-self-review.md) - extracted 6 strong statements

**15-03: Job Matcher Agent**
- Created `.claude/skills/job-matcher.md` skill with 5-step process
- Implemented weighted scoring algorithm:
  - Tag match: 40% (highest weight for direct requirement alignment)
  - Domain relevance: 25% (enterprise vs consumer, AI vs traditional)
  - Recency: 20% (2025-2024 full weight, declining for older work)
  - Impact magnitude: 15% (headline > featured > legacy)
- Included HR-optimized writing principles (numbers first, active voice, problem→solution framing)
- Added section-by-section file creation in `src/data/job-analysis/`
- Implemented gap analysis with honest framing and transferable experience suggestions
- Added YAML frontmatter to both job-matcher and profile-updater for proper invocation

### Phase 16: Profile Data System

**Status:** DEFERRED

Originally planned to implement markdown/YAML data storage. Deferred because Phase 15 already delivered the essential profile.yaml infrastructure.

### Phase 17: Impact Schema Foundation

**Status:** DEFERRED

Originally planned to design impact statement structure validation. Deferred because Phase 15 schema already includes comprehensive impact statement structure.

### Phase 18: Resume and CV Writer

**Goal**: Templated document generation system with smart content selection from profile.yaml for professional resumes and comprehensive CVs
**Depends on**: Phase 17 (originally planned, but executed without it)
**Research**: Unlikely (internal skill creation, established patterns)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 18-01: Resume Generator - Tactical 1-2 page resumes with XYZ formula, ATS-optimized (completed 2026-01-20)
- [x] 18-02: CV Generator - Comprehensive 3-6 page CVs with full career history (completed 2026-01-20)

**Status**: ✓ Complete (2/2 plans finished)

**Details:**

**18-01: Resume Generator**
- Created `skills/resume-generator.md` skill (416 lines)
- Implemented weighted scoring algorithm (reused from job-matcher)
- Built ATS-optimized resume template following Google XYZ formula
- Specified markdown and plain text output formats
- Incorporated 2026 resume best practices:
  - Single-column layout (multi-column confuses ATS parsers)
  - Standard fonts only (Arial, Calibri, Cambria at 11pt minimum)
  - No graphics, photos, charts, or visual skill indicators
  - Magazine cover header approach (large name, target role immediately visible)
  - Professional summary replaces objective statements
  - Skills grouped by category for scannability
  - XYZ formula enforced for all experience bullets
- Established human-in-the-loop review with content selection rationale

**18-02: CV Generator**
- Created `skills/cv-generator.md` skill (410 lines)
- Implemented chronological content organization (ALL career history, no filtering)
- Built multi-section CV template:
  - Core sections: Experience, Education, Certifications
  - Extended sections: Publications, Speaking, Teaching, Board Positions, Awards, Patents, Professional Affiliations
- Specified context-aware section ordering:
  - Executive/Board context
  - Academic/Speaking Circuit context
  - Comprehensive Documentation context
- Context influences emphasis, NOT content filtering
- Defined markdown and plain text output for 3-6 page CVs
- Maintained XYZ formula consistency with resume-generator

## Milestone Summary

**Phases Deferred:**
- Phase 16: Profile Data System (deferred - Phase 15 already provides necessary infrastructure)
- Phase 17: Impact Schema Foundation (deferred - Phase 15 schema already includes impact validation)

**Key Decisions:**

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 15.01 | YAML over JSON | More readable for content-heavy data |
| 15.01 | Separate from content collections | Data, not content; lives in `src/data/` |
| 15.01 | XYZ in two places | Detailed in experience, curated in impact_statements |
| 15.01 | Build-time validation | Zod schema validates at build, not runtime |
| 15.02 | Quality tiers (Strong/Needs Review/Weak) | Actionable assessment for XYZ statements |
| 15.02 | Human-in-the-loop only | Skill proposes, never auto-edits |
| 15.03 | Weighted scoring algorithm | 40% tag match, 25% domain, 20% recency, 15% impact |
| 15.03 | Section-by-section file creation | Prevents token overload, enables quality control |
| 15.03 | YAML frontmatter for skills | Enables `/skill-name` invocation syntax |
| 18.01 | Resume tactical filtering | 10-15 year experience window, job-matched content for 1-2 pages |
| 18.01 | ATS optimization | Single-column, standard fonts, no graphics, plain text output |
| 18.02 | CV comprehensive structure | ALL career history included, chronological completeness for 3-6 pages |
| 18.02 | CV context-aware emphasis | Section ordering adapts to context without filtering content |
| 18.02 | CV multi-section template | Publications, speaking, teaching, board positions, awards, patents, affiliations |

**Issues Resolved:**
- None reported

**Issues Deferred:**
- None reported

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None reported

**Lessons Learned:**
- Phase sequencing can be flexible when dependencies are logical rather than technical
- Deferring phases mid-milestone is acceptable when core value is delivered
- Weighted scoring algorithms are highly reusable across skills (job-matcher → resume-generator)
- Skills benefit from YAML frontmatter for discoverability and invocation
