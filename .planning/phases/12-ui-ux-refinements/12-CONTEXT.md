# Phase 12: UI/UX Refinements - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-12-31
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

This phase is about polish and consistency - making the site feel cohesive and intentionally designed as you navigate between pages. We've already tackled the header/navigation interactive elements (ripples, theme toggle, focus states) in plan 01.

The focus now shifts to the homepage hero section and ensuring visual consistency across all major pages (Home, Work, Writing, About).

**Homepage hero:** Needs less whitespace - currently feels too spacious. The vertical rhythm should be tightened up while maintaining the minimal, editorial feel.

**Page title consistency:** When navigating between Work, Writing, and About pages, the titles should match in size and location. Currently About looks different from the others, creating a jarring transition.

**Overall spacing:** Homepage spacing patterns should align with the rhythm established on /work and /writing pages. The site should feel unified - not like separate pages designed in isolation.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Visual consistency across pages** - Page titles match size and position, spacing rhythms align, navigation feels cohesive
- **Homepage polish** - Hero section has the right amount of breathing room (less than current) and makes a strong first impression
- **Unified feel** - The site should feel cohesive when moving between pages AND each page should feel intentionally designed

Both consistency and polish are equally important - this isn't just about matching patterns, it's about making each page feel right while also feeling part of a whole.

## What's Out of Scope

- **Content changes** - Not touching the actual text, images, or written content. This is purely layout and spacing refinement.
- **New features or functionality** - We're polishing what exists, not adding new interactive elements or components beyond what's already built.

Layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy adjustments only. The content and functionality stay as-is.

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- **Maintain the minimal, editorial aesthetic** - The current calm, editorial vibe is correct. We're tightening up the execution, not changing the direction.
- **Homepage hero:** Reduce vertical whitespace to create a more compact, focused entry point
- **Page titles:** Standardize size and position across Work, Writing, and About pages
- **Spacing rhythm:** Ensure homepage follows the same spacing patterns as /work and /writing pages

No specific external references - trust the established design system and editorial aesthetic already in place.

## Additional Context

Plan 12-01 already completed:
- Header/navigation interactive polish (Material ripples, theme toggle, focus states, touch targets)
- WCAG AAA compliance maintained
- Mobile breakpoint improvements

The remaining work focuses on content areas and page consistency, not navigation elements.

User prioritizes both polish and consistency equally - the site should feel unified AND each page should feel intentionally designed.
