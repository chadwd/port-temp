<objective>

**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**

- Design system uses warm color palette with editorial aesthetic (Phase 2)
- System fonts only, no custom fonts (Phase 2)
- Minimal, calm, confident aesthetic established (Phase 2)
- Spacing tokens defined in global.css (Phase 2)
- View Transitions enabled for page navigation (Phase 10)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Reduce homepage hero vertical spacing</name>
  <files>src/pages/index.astro</files>
  <action>
    Reduce the hero section's `padding-block` from `var(--space-24)` (6rem/96px) to a tighter value that maintains the minimal aesthetic while creating a more compact, focused entry point.

    Current: `.hero { padding-block: var(--space-24); }`

    Recommended: Use `var(--space-16)` (4rem/64px) for a 33% reduction that maintains breathing room while tightening the vertical rhythm. This aligns better with the `--space-12` used on Work/Writing headers.

    Do NOT change the internal hero spacing (h1 margin, intro margin) - only the outer padding-block value. The hero's internal structure is already well-balanced.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Read src/pages/index.astro and confirm `.hero { padding-block: var(--space-16); }`
    - Verify no other hero spacing changed (h1 margin, intro margin unchanged)
    - Run `npm run build` succeeds with no errors
  </verify>
  <done>Hero section uses var(--space-16) for padding-block, build passes, internal spacing unchanged</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Standardize page title structure across Work, Writing, and About</name>
  <files>src/pages/work/index.astro, src/pages/writing/index.astro, src/pages/about.astro</files>
  <action>
    Ensure consistent page title size and position across Work, Writing, and About pages.

    Current state:
    - Work: h1 in `.work-header` with `.intro` paragraph, `margin-bottom: var(--space-12)`
    - Writing: h1 in `.writing-header` with `.intro` paragraph, `margin-bottom: var(--space-12)`
    - About: h1 inside `.prose` with `padding-block: var(--space-12)`, different structure

    **Target structure (standardize on Work/Writing pattern):**

    For About page:
    1. Extract h1 from `.prose` into a dedicated header element like Work/Writing
    2. Create `.about-header` class matching `.work-header`/`.writing-header` pattern
    3. Add intro paragraph after h1 with description text
    4. Apply same `margin-bottom: var(--space-12)` spacing
    5. Keep `.prose` for the three sections (Background, Philosophy, Approach)

    This creates visual consistency: when navigating Work → Writing → About, the page titles appear in the same position with the same hierarchy.

    Why this approach: Work and Writing already follow a consistent pattern (header + intro + content). About should match this pattern rather than having a unique structure. The `.prose` class should apply only to the content sections below the header.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Work, Writing, and About all have h1 in a header element with matching structure
    - All three use consistent `margin-bottom: var(--space-12)` on header
    - About page has `.about-header` class following same pattern as `.work-header`/`.writing-header`
    - Run `npm run build` succeeds with no errors
  </verify>
  <done>All three pages have standardized title structure, visual consistency achieved, build passes</done>

  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: npm run dev
    2. Visit: http://localhost:3000 (homepage)
       - Check: Hero section feels tighter but not cramped
       - Check: Vertical rhythm feels intentional and cohesive
    3. Navigate to: /work
       - Check: Page title size and position
    4. Navigate to: /writing
       - Check: Page title matches Work page position
    5. Navigate to: /about
       - Check: Page title matches Work/Writing position (no jarring transition)
    6. Test navigation flow: Home → Work → Writing → About
       - Check: Pages feel unified, not like separate designs
       - Check: View Transitions animations feel smooth
    7. Mobile check: Resize to 375px width
       - Check: Spacing works on mobile viewport
       - Check: No layout breaks or overflow
