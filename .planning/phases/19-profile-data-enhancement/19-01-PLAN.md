**Source document:**

**Profile infrastructure:**
@src/data/profile.yaml
@src/data/schema.ts

**Extraction skill:**

**Prior decisions:**
- XYZ format: "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]"
- All three fields required (no nulls) per schema
- Profile-updater proposes changes only, never auto-edits
- User validates each source one at a time for accuracy and context attribution

  <name>Task 1: Extract accomplishments from 2021-2025 impact document</name>
  <files>src/data/sources/2021-2025-atlassian-impact.md</files>
  <action>
    Run the profile-updater skill against src/data/sources/2021-2025-atlassian-impact.md following the skill's process:
    1. Read the source document thoroughly
    2. Extract potential accomplishments with XYZ structure
    3. Apply quality assessment (Strong/Needs Review/Weak)
    4. Compare against existing profile.yaml to identify truly NEW accomplishments (avoid duplicates)
    5. Generate a proposal document with copy-paste ready YAML

    Output the proposal in conversation for user review. Group by:
    - Company/role context (ACV Auctions categories)
    - Year/timeframe
    - Quality tier

    Flag any accomplishments that:
    - Already exist in profile.yaml (skip these)
    - Have unclear project/context attribution
    - Need metric strengthening
  </action>
  <verify>Proposal output contains structured YAML with quality ratings and source attribution</verify>
  <done>Proposal generated with clear groupings, no duplicates of existing profile content</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Extracted accomplishment proposals from 2021-2025 impact document</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    Review each proposed accomplishment:
    1. Verify accuracy - does the XYZ statement match your actual work?
    2. Check context attribution - correct project, team, timeframe?
    3. Assess quality - are metrics accurate and specific enough?
    4. Decide: approve, edit, or reject each item

    For items to approve: Reply with "approved" or list specific items by number
    For items to edit: Provide corrected YAML
    For items to reject: Note which items to skip
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Reply with approval decisions: "approved all", list approved item numbers, or provide edits</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Apply approved changes to profile.yaml</name>
  <files>src/data/profile.yaml</files>
  <action>
    Based on user approval from checkpoint:
    1. Add approved accomplishments to appropriate sections of profile.yaml
    2. Place in correct experience category (ai_workflows, platform_leadership, enterprise_ownership, cross_functional)
    3. If new category needed, create it following existing structure
    4. Update impact_statements if any headline/featured caliber items approved
    5. Run npm run build to validate schema compliance

    Do NOT add:
    - Rejected items
    - Items user marked for later review
    - Duplicates of existing content
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds with no schema validation errors</verify>
  <done>Approved accomplishments added to profile.yaml, schema validates, ready for commit</done>
</task>

</tasks>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] All approved items added to correct sections
- [ ] No duplicate accomplishments in profile.yaml
- [ ] `npm run build` passes without errors
- [ ] XYZ format maintained (no null fields)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Source document processed completely
- User reviewed all extracted proposals
- Approved accomplishments integrated into profile.yaml
- Schema validation passes
- Clean state for next source document
</success_criteria>
