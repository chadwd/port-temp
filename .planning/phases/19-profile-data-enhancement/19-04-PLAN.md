**Extraction skill:**

**Prior decisions:**
- XYZ format: "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]"
- All three fields required (no nulls) per schema
- Profile-updater proposes changes only, never auto-edits
- User validates each source one at a time for accuracy and context attribution
- 19-01, 19-02, 19-03 already processed other sources - this is the final source

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Extract accomplishments from resume source document</name>
  <files>src/data/sources/resume.md</files>
  <action>
    Run the profile-updater skill against src/data/sources/resume.md:
    1. Read the source document thoroughly
    2. Extract potential accomplishments with XYZ structure
    3. Apply quality assessment (Strong/Needs Review/Weak)
    4. Compare against CURRENT profile.yaml to identify truly NEW accomplishments
    5. Generate a proposal document with copy-paste ready YAML

    Resume content is typically:
    - Already condensed and formatted
    - May have older career history not in other docs
    - May reference earlier roles (pre-ACV)

    Look specifically for:
    - Earlier career accomplishments (before 2017)
    - Rand McNally content that may have more detail than profile.yaml
    - Any roles or accomplishments missing from other sources

    Output the proposal in conversation for user review. Group by:
    - Company/role
    - Timeframe
    - Quality tier

    Flag any accomplishments that:
    - Already exist in profile.yaml (skip these)
    - Are from earlier career (may need context to validate)
    - Need expansion or metric strengthening
  </action>
  <verify>Proposal output contains structured YAML with quality ratings, focused on net-new content</verify>
  <done>Proposal generated identifying any remaining accomplishments not yet in profile.yaml</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Extracted accomplishment proposals from resume source document</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    Review each proposed accomplishment:
    1. Verify accuracy - especially for older career content
    2. Check context attribution - correct company, role, timeframe?
    3. Assess if earlier career items should be included
    4. Decide: approve, edit, or reject each item

    For items to approve: Reply with "approved" or list specific items by number
    For items to edit: Provide corrected YAML
    For items to reject: Note which items to skip

    If no new items found: Reply "none needed" to proceed to validation
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Reply with approval decisions, or "none needed" if resume content already covered</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Apply approved changes and perform final validation</name>
  <files>src/data/profile.yaml</files>
  <action>
    Based on user approval from checkpoint:
    1. Add any approved accomplishments to appropriate sections
    2. Run npm run build to validate schema compliance
    3. Perform final profile quality check:
       - All XYZ fields complete (no nulls)
       - No duplicate accomplishments
       - Accomplishments properly categorized
       - Impact statements reflect strongest achievements
    4. Report final profile statistics:
       - Total accomplishments by company/role
       - Impact statements count (headline/featured/legacy)
       - Projects documented

    This is the final plan in Phase 19 - ensure profile.yaml is complete and validated.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, profile.yaml fully validated</verify>
  <done>All source documents processed, profile.yaml complete and schema-validated</done>
</task>

</tasks>

Before declaring phase complete:
- [ ] All 4 source documents processed
- [ ] All approved items added to profile.yaml
- [ ] No duplicate accomplishments
- [ ] `npm run build` passes without errors
- [ ] XYZ format maintained throughout (no null fields)
- [ ] Profile statistics reported
