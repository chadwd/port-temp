**Profile infrastructure:**

**Extraction skill:**

**Prior decisions:**
- XYZ format: "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]"
- All three fields required (no nulls) per schema
- Profile-updater proposes changes only, never auto-edits
- User validates each source one at a time for accuracy and context attribution
- 19-01 already processed 2021-2025 comprehensive doc - avoid duplicates

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Extract accomplishments from 2025-focused impact document</name>
  <files>src/data/sources/2025-focused-atlassian-impact.md</files>
  <action>
    Run the profile-updater skill against src/data/sources/2025-focused-atlassian-impact.md:
    1. Read the source document thoroughly
    2. Extract potential accomplishments with XYZ structure
    3. Apply quality assessment (Strong/Needs Review/Weak)
    4. Compare against CURRENT profile.yaml (including 19-01 additions) to identify truly NEW accomplishments
    5. Generate a proposal document with copy-paste ready YAML

    This document focuses on 2025 - look for:
    - More recent/detailed metrics than 2021-2025 doc
    - Accomplishments with updated numbers or outcomes
    - New projects or initiatives not in comprehensive doc

    Output the proposal in conversation for user review. Group by:
    - Company/role context (ACV Auctions categories)
    - Project name
    - Quality tier

    Flag any accomplishments that:
    - Already exist in profile.yaml (skip these)
    - Are duplicates of 19-01 additions (skip these)
    - Have better metrics than existing entries (suggest as UPDATES)
    - Have unclear project/context attribution
  </action>
  <verify>Proposal output contains structured YAML with quality ratings, no duplicates of existing content</verify>
  <done>Proposal generated distinguishing new items from potential updates to existing entries</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Extracted accomplishment proposals from 2025-focused impact document</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    Review each proposed accomplishment:
    1. Verify accuracy - does the XYZ statement match your actual work?
    2. Check context attribution - correct project, team, timeframe?
    3. For UPDATE suggestions - confirm if new metrics should replace existing
    4. Decide: approve, edit, or reject each item

    For items to approve: Reply with "approved" or list specific items by number
    For items to edit: Provide corrected YAML
    For updates: Confirm "update [item]" to replace existing entry
    For items to reject: Note which items to skip
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Reply with approval decisions: "approved all", list approved item numbers, confirm updates, or provide edits</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Apply approved changes to profile.yaml</name>
  <files>src/data/profile.yaml</files>
  <action>
    Based on user approval from checkpoint:
    1. Add NEW approved accomplishments to appropriate sections
    2. UPDATE existing entries if user confirmed metric improvements
    3. Place in correct experience category
    4. Update impact_statements if any headline/featured caliber items approved
    5. Run npm run build to validate schema compliance

    Do NOT add:
    - Rejected items
    - Duplicates of existing content
    - Items user marked for later review
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds with no schema validation errors</verify>
  <done>Approved accomplishments added/updated in profile.yaml, schema validates</done>
</task>

</tasks>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] All approved items added to correct sections
- [ ] Any metric updates applied to existing entries
- [ ] No duplicate accomplishments in profile.yaml
- [ ] `npm run build` passes without errors
- [ ] XYZ format maintained (no null fields)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Source document processed completely
- User reviewed all extracted proposals
- Approved accomplishments integrated into profile.yaml
- Schema validation passes
- Clean state for next source document
