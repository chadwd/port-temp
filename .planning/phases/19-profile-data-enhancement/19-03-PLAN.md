<objective>
Extract and integrate accomplishments from 2025 self-review document.

Purpose: Process the self-review document (37KB) which contains personal reflection and narrative that may surface accomplishments framed differently than impact docs.
Output: Updated profile.yaml with validated XYZ accomplishments from self-review content.

**Prior decisions:**
- XYZ format: "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]"
- All three fields required (no nulls) per schema
- Profile-updater proposes changes only, never auto-edits
- User validates each source one at a time for accuracy and context attribution
- 19-01 and 19-02 already processed impact docs - avoid duplicates

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Extract accomplishments from 2025 self-review document</name>
  <files>src/data/sources/2025-self-review.md</files>
  <action>
    Run the profile-updater skill against src/data/sources/2025-self-review.md:
    1. Read the source document thoroughly
    2. Extract potential accomplishments with XYZ structure
    3. Apply quality assessment (Strong/Needs Review/Weak)
    4. Compare against CURRENT profile.yaml to identify truly NEW accomplishments
    5. Generate a proposal document with copy-paste ready YAML

    Self-reviews often contain:
    - Narrative framing of accomplishments (convert to XYZ)
    - Soft skills and leadership examples (may need metric strengthening)
    - Growth areas or challenges overcome
    - Collaboration and influence outcomes

    Be especially careful to:
    - Convert narrative ("I worked on...") to outcome ("Delivered...")
    - Extract implicit metrics from context
    - Flag "Needs Review" items that require user to add specific metrics

    Output the proposal in conversation for user review. Group by:
    - Company/role context
    - Accomplishment type (hard outcome vs leadership/influence)
    - Quality tier

    Flag any accomplishments that:
    - Already exist in profile.yaml (skip these)
    - Need metrics that only the user can provide
    - Represent soft skills without clear outcomes
  </action>
  <verify>Proposal output contains structured YAML with quality ratings, narrative converted to XYZ format</verify>
  <done>Proposal generated with self-review content transformed to XYZ accomplishments</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Extracted accomplishment proposals from 2025 self-review document</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    Review each proposed accomplishment:
    1. Verify accuracy - does the XYZ statement capture the essence correctly?
    2. Add missing metrics - self-reviews may lack specific numbers you can provide
    3. Check context attribution - correct project, team, timeframe?
    4. Decide: approve, edit (especially to add metrics), or reject each item

    For items to approve: Reply with "approved" or list specific items by number
    For items to edit: Provide corrected YAML with added metrics
    For items to reject: Note which items to skip
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Reply with approval decisions: "approved all", list approved item numbers, or provide edits with metrics</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Apply approved changes to profile.yaml</name>
  <files>src/data/profile.yaml</files>
  <action>
    Based on user approval from checkpoint:
    1. Add approved accomplishments to appropriate sections of profile.yaml
    2. Place in correct experience category
    3. If leadership-focused items, consider adding to leadership section
    4. Update impact_statements if any headline/featured caliber items approved
    5. Run npm run build to validate schema compliance

    Do NOT add:
    - Rejected items
    - Duplicates of existing content
    - Items without complete XYZ (user must provide missing metrics)
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds with no schema validation errors</verify>
  <done>Approved accomplishments added to profile.yaml, schema validates</done>
</task>

</tasks>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] All approved items added to correct sections
- [ ] Narrative content properly converted to XYZ format
- [ ] No duplicate accomplishments in profile.yaml
- [ ] `npm run build` passes without errors
- [ ] XYZ format maintained (no null fields)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Source document processed completely
- User reviewed all extracted proposals
- Approved accomplishments integrated into profile.yaml
- Schema validation passes
- Clean state for next source document
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/19-profile-data-enhancement/19-03-SUMMARY.md`:
