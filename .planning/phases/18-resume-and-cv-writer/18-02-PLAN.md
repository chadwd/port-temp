@.planning/phases/18-resume-and-cv-writer/18-01-SUMMARY.md

**Phase context (from /gsd:discuss-phase):**
- Comprehensive CV format (full career history, publications, speaking, teaching)
- Different from resume: chronological completeness vs tactical targeting
- Same underlying intelligence and profile data as resume generator
- Markdown and plain text output only

**Resume/CV standards references:**
@src/data/resume-guidelines/modern-resume-standards-2026.md
@src/data/resume-guidelines/modern-resume-architecture.md
@src/data/resume-guidelines/strategic-framework-resume.md

**Existing patterns:**
@.claude/skills/resume-generator.md - Resume generator created in 18-01
@.claude/skills/job-matcher.md - Content selection patterns
@.claude/skills/profile-updater.md - Skill structure

**Profile data source:**
@src/data/profile.yaml - Professional profile (single source of truth)
@src/data/schema.ts - Zod validation schema

**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- From Phase 18-01: Resume generator structure and template patterns
- From Phase 15: profile.yaml structure with comprehensive career data
- YAML frontmatter skill pattern established

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create CV generator skill structure</name>
  <files>.claude/skills/cv-generator.md</files>
  <action>
Create skill file with YAML frontmatter (name: cv-generator, description: Generate comprehensive CVs from profile data, location: user) and XML sections:

- `<purpose>`: Generate comprehensive curriculum vitae for academic/senior professional contexts (career documentation, speaking engagements, board positions, consulting)
- `<context>`: Reference profile.yaml, schema.ts, resume-generator.md for shared patterns
- `<process>`: Placeholder sections (will populate in Task 2)
- `<output>`: Markdown and plain text CV formats
- `<anti_patterns>`: Tactical resume patterns (skip selective filtering), visual complexity
- `<human_in_the_loop>`: Review for completeness before final output

Key difference from resume-generator: CV is comprehensive and chronological, not tactically filtered. Include ALL career history, not just last 10-15 years.

Use resume-generator.md as structural template. Follow section-by-section Write + Edit pattern to prevent token overload.

</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Implement comprehensive content selection logic</name>
  <files>.claude/skills/cv-generator.md</files>
  <action>
Edit the `<process>` section to add CV-specific content organization:

**Step 1: Parse CV context**
- Accept optional context (e.g., "Executive CV for board positions", "Academic CV for speaking circuit")
- Context influences emphasis and ordering, not content filtering
- Default: comprehensive career documentation

**Step 2: Organize content by category and chronology**
Unlike resume tactical filtering, CV includes everything organized by:

**Professional Experience:**
- ALL roles in reverse chronological order (no 10-15 year limit)
- Group by employer/company
- Full date ranges (month/year format)
- Complete scope for each role (team size, budget, reporting structure)

**Impact Statements:**
- Include ALL headline and featured tier accomplishments
- Group by role/timeframe
- Maintain Google XYZ formula for clarity
- Legacy tier: include if space permits or historically significant

**Additional Sections (CV-specific):**
- Publications & Articles (if present in profile.yaml)
- Speaking Engagements & Conferences
- Teaching & Mentoring
- Board Positions & Advisory Roles
- Awards & Recognition
- Patents & Intellectual Property
- Professional Affiliations
- Certifications & Continuing Education

**Step 3: Emphasize based on context**
If context provided (e.g., "board position CV"):
- Reorder sections to highlight relevant areas first
- Add brief positioning statement
- Don't filter content, just reorganize priority

Avoid resume anti-patterns: don't selectively filter to fit page count, don't skip older experience, don't use tactical job-matching logic.

  <verify>Process section contains comprehensive content organization logic with chronological completeness, no tactical filtering</verify>
  <done>Content organization fully specified with CV-appropriate completeness, chronological structure, and emphasis options</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Build CV template and output formatting</name>
  <files>.claude/skills/cv-generator.md</files>
  <action>
Add to `<process>` section the CV template structure:

**CV structure (comprehensive format):**

1. **Header** (professional identity):
   - Full Name (large, prominent)
   - Professional Title/Positioning (e.g., "Principal Product Designer | AI/Blockchain Innovation")
   - Contact: City, State | Phone | Email | LinkedIn | Portfolio
   - Optional: Brief positioning statement if context provided

2. **Professional Summary** (optional, context-dependent):
   - Use if context suggests (e.g., board CV, speaking circuit)
   - 3-4 sentences highlighting career trajectory and expertise
   - Emphasize scope, impact, and domain authority

3. **Professional Experience** (complete chronology):
   - ALL roles in reverse chronological order
   - Company, Title, Date Range (Month/Year - Month/Year)
   - Brief role description (scope, team size, reporting)
   - 5-8 bullet points per significant role using XYZ formula
   - Recent roles: more detail; historical roles: summary acceptable
   - No cutoff date - include full career history

4. **Key Accomplishments** (optional highlight section):
   - Top 10-15 headline achievements across career
   - Grouped by domain/theme if helpful
   - Cross-reference to roles where they occurred

5. **Publications & Writing**:
   - Articles, papers, blog posts
   - Format: Title, Publication, Date
   - Include links where available

6. **Speaking & Presentations**:
   - Conference talks, workshops, panels
   - Format: Event, Topic, Date, Location

7. **Education & Certifications**:
   - Degrees (Institution, Degree, Year)
   - Professional certifications
   - Continuing education relevant to expertise

8. **Professional Affiliations**:
   - Industry organizations
   - Advisory boards
   - Community involvement

9. **Skills & Expertise** (comprehensive):
   - Domain expertise areas
   - Technical proficiencies
   - Methodologies and frameworks
   - Languages (if applicable)

**Output formats:**
- **Markdown** (.md): Source format, comprehensive documentation
- **Plain text** (.txt): Clean multi-page format for submission

**Formatting considerations:**
- Multi-page is expected and appropriate (typically 3-6 pages)
- Clean, professional formatting (same font standards as resume)
- Clear section headers and hierarchy
- Chronological organization within sections
- Consistent date formatting (Month Year)

**Key differences from resume:**
- Comprehensive vs selective (include everything relevant)
- Chronological vs targeted (full career history)
- Multi-page vs 1-2 pages (space to tell full story)
- Career documentation vs job application tool
