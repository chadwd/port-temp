<objective>
Create resume generator skill that produces tailored, ATS-optimized resumes from profile.yaml for specific job applications.

Purpose: Enable quick generation of professional resumes following modern 2026 standards (Google XYZ formula, quantified achievements, ATS-friendly formatting) with smart content selection based on job context.
Output: Functional resume generator skill at `.claude/skills/resume-generator.md` that produces markdown and plain text resumes.

**Phase context (from /gsd:discuss-phase):**
- Smart content selection logic is the core value
- Must follow 2026 resume standards (XYZ formula, ATS-optimized, quantified)
- Manual override capability for user review
- Markdown and plain text output only (no PDF in this phase)

**Resume standards references:**
@src/data/resume-guidelines/modern-resume-standards-2026.md
@src/data/resume-guidelines/modern-resume-architecture.md
@src/data/resume-guidelines/strategic-framework-resume.md

**Existing skill patterns:**
@.claude/skills/job-matcher.md - Established pattern for content selection and scoring
@.claude/skills/profile-updater.md - Established pattern for skill structure

**Profile data source:**
@src/data/profile.yaml - Professional profile (single source of truth)
@src/data/schema.ts - Zod validation schema

**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- From Phase 15: profile.yaml structure with impact_statements and accomplishments
- From Phase 15.03: Weighted scoring algorithm (tag match 40%, domain 25%, recency 20%, impact 15%)
- YAML frontmatter skill pattern from Phase 15.02

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create resume generator skill structure</name>
  <files>.claude/skills/resume-generator.md</files>
  <action>
Create skill file with YAML frontmatter (name: resume-generator, description: Generate tailored resumes from profile data, location: user) and XML sections:

- `<purpose>`: Generate 1-2 page tactical resumes for job applications following 2026 standards
- `<context>`: Reference profile.yaml, schema.ts, resume guideline docs
- `<process>`: Placeholder sections (will populate in Task 2)
- `<output>`: Markdown and plain text resume formats
- `<anti_patterns>`: Generic resumes, duty lists without achievements, ATS-unfriendly formatting
- `<human_in_the_loop>`: Review and manual override before final output

Use job-matcher.md skill as structural template. Follow section-by-section Write + Edit pattern from Phase 15.02 to prevent token overload (Write header + purpose, Edit to add each subsequent section).
  </action>
  <verify>File exists at .claude/skills/resume-generator.md with YAML frontmatter and basic XML structure</verify>
  <done>Skill structure created with all required sections defined</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Implement content selection and scoring logic</name>
  <files>.claude/skills/resume-generator.md</files>
  <action>
Edit the `<process>` section to add intelligent content selection steps:

**Step 1: Parse job context**
- Accept job posting (URL, text, or file) OR general context (e.g., "Staff Product Designer at AI startup")
- Extract role level (senior, staff, principal), domain focus, key requirements
- Identify top 5-7 skills/domains needed

**Step 2: Score profile content for relevance**
Use weighted scoring algorithm from job-matcher (Phase 15.03):
- Tag match (40%): Direct alignment with job requirements
- Domain relevance (25%): Industry/product type alignment
- Recency (20%): 2025-2024 full weight, 2023-2020 (0.8x), older (0.6x)
- Impact magnitude (15%): headline > featured > legacy tier

**Step 3: Select top 7-10 impact statements**
- Prioritize headline/featured tier for "top fold" impact
- Include mix of leadership, technical, and business outcomes
- Ensure diversity across skill domains (don't cluster on one area)

**Step 4: Structure experience section**
- Group by employer/role (most recent first)
- Use Google XYZ formula: "Accomplished X as measured by Y by doing Z"
- Quantify everything (percentages, dollar amounts, timeframes)
- Limit to last 10-15 years of relevant experience

Include guidance on avoiding common pitfalls: duty lists ("responsible for"), soft skill fluff, ATS-unfriendly formatting (graphics, multi-column, weird fonts).
  </action>
  <verify>Process section contains detailed scoring algorithm and selection logic matching job-matcher patterns</verify>
  <done>Content selection logic fully specified with weighted scoring, XYZ formula guidance, and anti-patterns</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Build resume template and output formatting</name>
  <files>.claude/skills/resume-generator.md</files>
  <action>
Add to `<process>` section the final output template generation:

**Resume structure (following modern-resume-architecture.md standards):**

1. **Header** (magazine cover approach):
   - Name (large, prominent)
   - City, State (no street address for privacy)
   - Phone | Email | LinkedIn (customized URL)
   - Target role title immediately below name

2. **Professional Summary** (replaces old objective):
   - Power-packed trio of key skills aligned to job
   - 2-3 sentence value proposition
   - Lead with impact, not generic phrases

3. **Professional Experience** (highlight reel):
   - Company, Role Title, Date Range (no older than 10-15 years)
   - 4-6 bullet points per role using Google XYZ formula
   - Quantified achievements (%, $, timeframes)
   - Recent/relevant roles get more detail

4. **Skills/Tech Stack** (contextual, not list):
   - Group by category (Design Tools, Technical Skills, Domains)
   - Specify proficiency where relevant (e.g., Advanced Excel)

5. **Education**:
   - Bottom placement for experienced professionals
   - Institution, Degree, relevant coursework
   - Omit graduation dates if >3 years ago (avoid age bias)

**Output formats:**
- **Markdown** (.md): Source format, human-readable, version controlled
- **Plain text** (.txt): ATS-friendly, single column, clean formatting

**Formatting rules** (critical for ATS):
- Single column layout only (no multi-column)
- Standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Cambria at 11pt)
- No graphics, photos, charts, or visual elements
- Left-aligned, consistent spacing
- 1-2 pages maximum (2 pages is norm for experienced professionals)

Add guidance on keyword integration: pepper keywords naturally from job description throughout experience bullets, don't stuff or use white text tricks.
  </action>
  <verify>Template structure matches modern-resume-architecture.md standards, includes both markdown and plain text output specs</verify>
  <done>Complete resume template with ATS-optimized structure, output format specifications, and formatting rules</done>
