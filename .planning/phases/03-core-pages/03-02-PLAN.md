**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- Design tokens from Phase 2 (typography, colors, spacing)
- Header/Footer from Plan 1 (already in BaseLayout)
- Content-first, minimal aesthetic
- Contact approach: TBD (email link vs form) - default to simple email link

**Page requirements from PROJECT.md:**
- Home: introduction + featured case studies (case studies come in Phase 4)
- About: bio, background, design philosophy
- Contact: way to reach out

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build Home page with hero and placeholder sections</name>
  <files>src/pages/index.astro</files>
  <action>
    Rebuild the Home page with proper structure:

    **Hero section:**
    - Large headline introducing the designer (use --text-5xl)
    - Brief tagline/intro paragraph (1-2 sentences)
    - Use .container for width constraint
    - Generous vertical padding (--space-16 or --space-24)

    **Featured Work section (placeholder for Phase 4):**
    - Section heading: "Selected Work" or "Featured Projects"
    - Placeholder text: "Case studies coming soon" or empty grid
    - This will be populated in Phase 4 with actual case study cards

    **Keep it minimal:**
    - No decorative elements
    - Strong typography hierarchy
    - Lots of whitespace
    - Content placeholder text that reads naturally

    Use semantic HTML: main, section, h1, p, etc.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - npm run dev shows updated homepage
    - Hero text is prominent and readable
    - npm run build succeeds
  </verify>
  <done>Home page with hero section and placeholder for featured work</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create About page</name>
  <files>src/pages/about.astro</files>
  <action>
    Create About page with:

    **Structure:**
    - Page title/heading
    - Bio section (placeholder text for now)
    - Design philosophy section
    - Background/experience section

    **Content approach:**
    - Use .prose class for typography styling
    - Placeholder content that indicates what goes where
    - Example placeholder: "A brief bio about the designer's background in AI and blockchain product design..."

    **Styling:**
    - Use .container for width
    - Apply .prose class to content area
    - Max-width for comfortable reading (--max-width-content)
    - Generous spacing between sections

    **Layout:**
    - Simple single-column layout
    - Could have optional sidebar for quick facts (skip for v1, keep simple)
    - Photo placeholder area (optional, can add later)
  </action>
  <verify>
    - /about route works
    - Page renders with placeholder content
    - Navigation highlights "About" as active
    - npm run build succeeds
  </verify>
  <done>About page with placeholder bio, philosophy, and background sections</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create Contact page</name>
  <files>src/pages/contact.astro</files>
  <action>
    Create Contact page with:

    **Structure:**
    - Page heading
    - Brief intro text
    - Primary contact method (email link)
    - Optional: social/professional links (LinkedIn, Twitter/X)

    **Email approach (simple, no form):**
    - mailto: link with clear call-to-action
    - Example: "Get in touch at email@example.com"
    - Style the email as a prominent link

    **Why no form:**
    - Static site on GitHub Pages
    - Forms require external service (Formspree, Netlify Forms)
    - Email link is simpler and more direct for v1
    - Can add form later if needed

    **Styling:**
    - Use .container
    - Center content or left-align (keep consistent with other pages)
    - Generous whitespace
    - Make email link visually prominent but not garish
  </action>
  <verify>
    - /contact route works
    - Email link is clickable
    - Navigation highlights "Contact" as active
    - npm run build succeeds
  </verify>
  <done>Contact page with email link and optional social links</done>
</task>
