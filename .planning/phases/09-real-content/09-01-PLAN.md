phase: 09-real-content
type: execute

<objective>
Replace sample content with 2 real pieces: 1 case study + 1 article, properly formatted with images.

Purpose: Transform the portfolio from placeholder content to professional showcase pieces, leveraging the image infrastructure and design system built in earlier phases.
Output: 1 polished case study and 1 polished article, both with proper frontmatter, cover images, and markdown formatting. Sample placeholders removed.

**Phase context (user vision):**
- Focus is on proper formatting and presentation, not content creation
- Content pieces already selected and exist as files
- Images need to look great using Phase 7 image infrastructure
- Match the editorial feel from Phase 2 design system
- Essential: Proper formatting, images displaying correctly

**Prior phase dependencies:**
- Phase 7: Image infrastructure (responsive components, schema with coverImage field)
- Phase 4: Case study collection schema and patterns
- Phase 5: Writing collection schema and patterns
- Phase 2: Design system (editorial feel, typography, spacing)

**Relevant source files:**
@src/content/config.ts
@src/content/case-studies/sample-project.md

**Source materials provided:**
- **Case study (ds-bridge):**
  - Full version: `src/content/case-studies/ds-bridge/ds_bridge_whitelabel_poc_case_study.md`
  - Exec summary: `src/content/case-studies/ds-bridge/ds_bridge_whitelabel_poc_case_study_execsummary.md`
  - Images: `src/content/case-studies/ds-bridge/images/` (already exists)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build ds-bridge.md case study from source materials</name>
  <files>src/content/case-studies/ds-bridge.md, src/content/case-studies/sample-project.md</files>
  <action>
    1. Read the 2 source files in `src/content/case-studies/ds-bridge/`:
       - `ds_bridge_whitelabel_poc_case_study.md` (full version)
       - `ds_bridge_whitelabel_poc_case_study_execsummary.md` (summary)
    2. Create/update `src/content/case-studies/ds-bridge.md` with proper frontmatter:
       - title: string (extract from source content)
       - description: string (use exec summary or create concise description)
       - date: date (YYYY-MM-DD format - use appropriate project date)
       - featured: true (for homepage display)
       - confidentiality: 'public' | 'partial' | 'nda' (determine from content)
       - tags: array of strings (extract relevant tags from content)
       - coverImage: image() reference using Phase 7 helper (e.g., `./ds-bridge/images/cover.jpg`)
    3. Check `src/content/case-studies/ds-bridge/images/` directory for available images
    4. Select appropriate cover image and reference it in frontmatter
    5. Format the markdown content from source files:
       - Use proper heading hierarchy (## for main sections)
       - Preserve content structure from source files
       - Add any inline image references if needed
       - Ensure editorial feel matches Phase 2 design system
    6. Remove `sample-project.md` placeholder
    7. Verify frontmatter parses correctly (no YAML syntax errors)
  </action>
  <verify>
    - npm run build succeeds without content collection errors
    - ds-bridge case study appears on /work page
    - Cover image displays on card (check build output for image optimization)
    - No TypeScript errors related to frontmatter schema
    - Case study detail page renders at /work/ds-bridge
  </verify>
  <done>
    - ds-bridge.md created with valid frontmatter and content
    - Cover image properly referenced from images/ directory
    - Content formatted with proper markdown structure
    - Sample placeholder removed
    - Build passes

  <files>src/content/writing/designing-at-the-speed-of-thought.md, src/content/writing/sample-essay.md</files>
  <action>
    1. Read source file: `src/content/writing/writing-01/designing_at_the_speed_of_thought_how_claude_code_unlocks_a_new_creative_tier_for_designers.md`
    2. Create `src/content/writing/designing-at-the-speed-of-thought.md` (or similar slug) with proper frontmatter:
       - title: string (extract from source - likely "Designing at the Speed of Thought")
       - description: string (create concise description from content)
       - date: date (YYYY-MM-DD format - use 2025-12-30 or appropriate date)
       - tags: array of strings (e.g., ["Design", "AI", "Claude", "Tools"])
       - coverImage: image() reference to `./writing-01/writing-01-hero.png`
    3. Format the markdown content from source file:
       - Use proper heading hierarchy (## for main sections)
       - Preserve content structure and writing voice
       - Ensure editorial feel matches Phase 2 design system
       - Verify inline formatting (bold, italic, lists, code blocks if any)
    4. Move or reference the hero image properly (writing-01-hero.png is already in writing-01/ folder)
    5. Remove `sample-essay.md` placeholder
    6. Verify frontmatter parses correctly (no YAML syntax errors)
  </action>
  <verify>
    - npm run build succeeds without content collection errors

# Phase 9 Plan 1: Real Content Integration Summary

**Real portfolio content published with professional formatting and optimized images**

## Accomplishments

- Built ds-bridge case study from source materials with cover image and proper schema
- Built "Designing at the Speed of Thought" article from source material with hero image
- Removed sample placeholder content
- Verified image optimization and display

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/content/case-studies/ds-bridge.md` - Design system bridge whitelabel POC case study
- `src/content/writing/designing-at-the-speed-of-thought.md` - Article on Claude Code for designers
- Deleted: `src/content/case-studies/sample-project.md`
- Deleted: `src/content/writing/sample-essay.md`

## Decisions Made

- Used ds-bridge for case study showcase (whitelabel POC project)
- Used "Designing at the Speed of Thought" for writing showcase (Claude Code + design)
- [Any formatting or presentation decisions made during implementation]

## Issues Encountered

[Any issues with image formats, frontmatter, or markdown structure - or "None"]

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 9 complete. Ready for Phase 10: UX Polish (404/error pages, loading states, page transitions, accessibility).
