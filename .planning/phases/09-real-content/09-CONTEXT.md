# Phase 9: Real Content - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-12-30
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Replace sample content with 2 specific pieces already selected: 1 complete case study + 1 complete article. These are existing works chosen to showcase my best portfolio content. The focus is on getting them properly formatted and presented on the site, not on writing or creating new content from scratch.

</vision>

<essential>
## What Must Be Nailed

- **Proper formatting and presentation** - Images, layout, and markdown structure must work perfectly. The content needs to look great visually, leveraging the image infrastructure and design system we've built.
- **Images need to look great** - Cover images and inline images properly optimized and displayed using the responsive image components from Phase 7.

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- Writing multiple pieces - Just 1 case study + 1 article, not building a full content library
- Content creation or ideation - The 2 pieces are already selected, no need to consider other options
- SEO optimization or analytics - Not in scope for this phase
- Content strategy or editorial planning - Not defining a calendar or roadmap

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Use the existing image infrastructure from Phase 7 (responsive components, optimization)
- Match the editorial feel established in Phase 2 design system (calm, confident, minimal)
- Leverage existing markdown patterns from Phases 4-5 (case studies and writing sections)
- Content pieces are pre-selected, ready to be formatted and published

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This phase is about presentation quality, not content creation. The user has already chosen the 2 pieces to showcase. Success means those pieces look professional and polished using all the infrastructure we've built (design system, image components, markdown collections).
