**Phase context:**
- Essential: Images need to look great using Phase 7 image infrastructure
- Match editorial feel from Phase 2 design system
- Focus on proper formatting and presentation

**Prior work (09-01):**
- ds-bridge.md has coverImage: ./ds-bridge/images/DS Bridge Hero.png
- designing-at-the-speed-of-thought.md has coverImage: ../writing-01-source/writing-01-hero.png
- 7 additional images in ds-bridge/images/ directory ready for inline use
- Phase 7 built responsive image components (HeroImage, ResponsiveImage)

**Available images:**
- ds-bridge: Agent Knowledge.png, Agent Work Journal.png, DS Bridge Hero.png, Final Summary of Session.png, GSale Component Demo.png, GSale Component Overview.png, GSale Component Props.png
- writing: writing-01-hero.png

**User requirements:**
- Hero images should display on cards (list views) AND at top of detail pages
- May have multiple images per page, positioned based on content sections
- Inline images should be embedded in markdown at appropriate sections
- Need comprehensive tag taxonomy for all content

**Relevant files:**
@src/content/config.ts
@src/components/CaseStudyCard.astro
@src/pages/work/[...slug].astro
@src/pages/writing/[...slug].astro

  <files>src/components/CaseStudyCard.astro, src/pages/work/[...slug].astro, src/pages/writing/[...slug].astro, src/pages/index.astro</files>
  <action>
    1. Read existing CaseStudyCard.astro component to understand current structure
    2. Check if coverImage is already being used - if not, add image display:
       - Import Image component from astro:assets (Phase 7 infrastructure)
       - Add conditional rendering for coverImage field
       - Use Image component with appropriate widths/formats for card context
       - Ensure lazy loading for performance
    3. Read work/[...slug].astro (case study detail page):
       - Add hero image at top of page if coverImage exists
       - Use HeroImage component or Image with hero sizing
       - Position above content, full-width or contained based on design system
    4. Read writing/[...slug].astro (article detail page):
       - Add hero image at top of page if coverImage exists
       - Consistent styling with case study pages
    5. Check homepage (index.astro) for featured content cards:
       - Ensure hero images display on featured case studies/articles
    6. Verify images use Phase 7 optimization (AVIF/WebP/JPG formats, responsive sizing)
  </action>
  <verify>
    - npm run build succeeds
    - /work page shows cover image on ds-bridge card
    - /work/ds-bridge shows hero image at top
    - /writing page shows cover image on article cards
    - /writing/designing-at-the-speed-of-thought shows hero at top
    - Images are optimized (check build output for format generation)
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Hero images display on all card components
    - Hero images display at top of all detail pages
    - Image optimization working (multiple formats generated)

    1. Review existing tags across all content:
       - ds-bridge: ["Design Systems", "AI Tools", "Workflow Design", "Collaboration"]
       - designing-at-the-speed-of-thought: ["Design", "AI", "Claude Code", "Workflow", "Creativity"]
       - Check other content files for existing tags
    2. Define tag taxonomy with consistent categories:
       - Technology: "Design Systems", "AI", "Machine Learning", etc.
       - Practice: "Product Design", "UX Design", "Workflow Design", etc.
       - Tools: "Claude Code", "Figma", etc.
       - Domain: "Automotive", "Blockchain", "Enterprise", etc.
       - Approach: "Collaboration", "Strategy", "Research", etc.
    3. Standardize casing: Use Title Case for all tags
    4. Apply taxonomy to existing content:
       - Review ds-bridge tags, adjust for consistency
       - Review article tags, adjust for consistency
       - Update any other content files (new-car-pricing, baseball-cards, chatgpt-2025, first-principles)
    5. Document tag taxonomy in a comment or reference file for future content
  </action>
  <verify>
    - All content has consistent tag formatting
    - Tags follow defined taxonomy categories
    - npm run build succeeds (tags validate against schema)
    - Tag display on pages looks clean and consistent

  <done>
    - Tag taxonomy defined and documented
    - All existing content updated with standardized tags
    - Tags follow Title Case convention

  <name>Task 3: Add inline images to ds-bridge case study content</name>
  <files>src/content/case-studies/ds-bridge.md</files>
  <action>
    1. Review ds-bridge.md content structure and identify sections:
       - Current sections: Overview, The Problem, What Changed, Strategy and Approach, etc.
    2. Review available images in ds-bridge/images/:
       - Agent Knowledge.png
       - Agent Work Journal.png
       - Final Summary of Session.png
       - GSale Component Demo.png
       - GSale Component Overview.png
       - GSale Component Props.png
       - DS Bridge Hero.png (already used as coverImage)
    3. Add inline images using Phase 7 image syntax:
       - Use relative paths: ![Alt text](./ds-bridge/images/filename.png)
       - Or use Image component import if needed for more control
    4. Position images based on content sections:
       - Place images near relevant text that they illustrate
       - Use descriptive alt text for accessibility
       - Consider flow: don't cluster all images together
    5. Suggested placements (user can override):
       - "What Changed" or "Strategy" section: Agent Work Journal.png or Agent Knowledge.png
       - Component demo/outcome sections: GSale Component Demo.png, GSale Component Overview.png
       - Supporting sections: Final Summary of Session.png, GSale Component Props.png
    6. Ensure images don't break markdown flow
    7. Test that images load correctly and are optimized

  <verify>
    - npm run build succeeds
    - /work/ds-bridge shows inline images in content
    - Images are positioned appropriately within sections
    - All images load and are optimized (check network tab or build output)
    - Alt text is descriptive for accessibility
  </verify>
  <done>
    - 4-6 inline images added to ds-bridge case study
    - Images positioned based on content sections
    - All images optimized via Phase 7 infrastructure
    - Markdown formatting preserved
