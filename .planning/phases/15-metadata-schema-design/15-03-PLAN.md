<objective>
Create Job Matcher Agent skill that extracts the most relevant accomplishments from profile.yaml for specific job postings, with output optimized for HR reviewers seeing 200+ applications daily.

Purpose: Enable tailored job applications that cut through resume fatigue - scannable, engaging, focused on solving the company's specific people/skill problem
Output: Working skill file at `.claude/skills/job-matcher.md` with job posting analysis, relevance scoring, and HR-optimized writing guidance

**Prior phase deliverables:**
@.planning/phases/15-metadata-schema-design/15-01-SUMMARY.md
@.planning/phases/15-metadata-schema-design/15-02-SUMMARY.md

**Pattern reference - existing skill structure to follow:**
@.claude/skills/profile-updater.md

**Data sources the skill will reference:**
@src/data/schema.ts - Zod validation schema (ImpactStatement, Accomplishment types)
@src/data/profile.yaml - Professional profile (single source of truth)
@src/data/index.ts - Helper functions (getImpactStatementsByTag, getAllAccomplishments)

**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- Skill structure uses `<purpose>`, `<process>`, `<examples>`, `<anti_patterns>`, `<human_in_the_loop>` sections
- Profile data is in XYZ format: "Accomplished X, Measured by Y, By doing Z"
- Impact statements have tags for categorization (ai, business-impact, design-systems, etc.)
- Human always reviews output - skill proposes, never auto-edits

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create skill foundation (purpose, context, process outline)</name>
  <files>.claude/skills/job-matcher.md</files>
  <action>
Create skill file with core structure. Follow profile-updater.md pattern.

Write the following sections:

**<purpose>**
- Goal: Match profile accomplishments to job postings for tailored applications
- Output optimized for HR reviewers seeing 200+ applications daily
- Note: This is for specific role targeting, not generic resume output

**<context>**
Reference the data sources:
- @src/data/schema.ts - Zod validation schema
- @src/data/profile.yaml - Professional profile (single source of truth)
- @src/data/index.ts - Helper functions
- Job posting file (provided by user)

**<process>**
Brief outline of 5 steps (details in next task):
1. Ingest job posting
2. Extract key requirements
3. Score profile data against requirements
4. Rank and select top 5-7 matches
5. Identify gaps

Keep this task SIMPLE - just the skeleton structure. No detailed step content yet.

  <verify>
- File exists at .claude/skills/job-matcher.md
- Contains <purpose>, <context>, <process> sections
- Process has 5 numbered steps outlined
  </verify>
  <done>
Skill foundation created with core sections
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add detailed process steps</name>
  <files>.claude/skills/job-matcher.md</files>
  <action>
Expand the <process> section with full details for each step.

For each of the 5 steps, add:

**Step 1: Ingest job posting**
- Parse URL, text, or file path
- Extract role title, company, requirements

**Step 2: Extract key requirements**
- Required skills (explicit and implicit)
- Level indicators (senior, staff, principal, etc.)
- Domain focus (enterprise, B2C, AI, design systems, etc.)
- Key responsibilities and deliverables
- Cultural/team signals

**Step 3: Score profile data**
For each impact_statement and accomplishment:
- Tag match (direct match to extracted requirements)
- Domain relevance (enterprise vs consumer, AI vs traditional)
- Recency (2025 > 2013)
- Impact magnitude (headline > featured > legacy, quantified > qualitative)

**Step 4: Rank and select**
Return top 5-7 statements with:
- Why each was selected (which requirement it addresses)
- Suggested positioning (lead with this for X reason)

**Step 5: Identify gaps**
- Flag where profile lacks evidence for key requirements
- Suggest adjacent experience as transferable

Keep this focused on PROCESS STEPS only. Don't add examples or output format yet.

  <action>
Add <output_format> section with the complete markdown template.

Include:
- Job Match Analysis header (role, company, match strength)
- The Problem They're Solving section
- Your Direct Value section (5-7 matches with labels, rewritten statements, their need, your proof)
- Gaps to Address Honestly section
- Your Narrative Arc section
- Opening Hook Options section

Use the exact structure from the plan. Keep it as a markdown template with [bracketed placeholders].

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 4: Add writing principles section</name>
  <files>.claude/skills/job-matcher.md</files>
  <action>
Add <writing_principles> section.

Include:
- Context: HR managers see 200+ applications daily
- Voice guidelines (5 principles: lead with outcomes, numbers first, active language, problem→solution, confident not arrogant)
- What to avoid (5 items: jargon walls, passive voice, vague claims, long paragraphs, generic phrases)
- The mindset: You're answering "Can this person solve the problem we're hiring for?"

Keep this section concise. Focus on actionable guidance.

  <verify>
- <writing_principles> section exists

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 5: Add examples and anti-patterns</name>
  <files>.claude/skills/job-matcher.md</files>
  <action>
Add two final sections:

**<examples>**
Include 2 worked examples:
1. Good match transformation (raw → HR-optimized → why it works)
   - Use the Project N.E.X.T. example from the plan
2. Partial match with honest framing
   - Use the enterprise data visualization example from the plan

**<anti_patterns>**
List 8 patterns to avoid:
- Resume-speak
- Burying the lead
- Wall of text
- Generic statements
- Overloading
- Ignoring level mismatch
- Pretending perfection
- Passive/weak language

Keep examples concrete and concise.

  <how-to-verify>
    1. Review the skill file structure - does it follow the profile-updater.md pattern?
    2. Run the skill with a real job posting:
       - Find a Staff or Principal Product Designer posting (LinkedIn, Greenhouse, Lever)
       - Invoke: "Use the job-matcher skill to analyze [job posting URL or paste]"
    3. Verify output includes:
       - 5-7 relevant accomplishments from profile.yaml
       - Clear reasoning for each match
       - Gap analysis for missing requirements
       - Talking points summary
    4. Check that recommendations are actually relevant to the posting (not generic)
