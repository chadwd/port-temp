# Phase 14.1: Copy Improvements and Resume - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-01
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Polish all existing copy across the site so it's production-ready for hiring managers. Every page should read as finished, professional, and reflect my voice as a senior product designer. The resume PDF just needs to be added — the link placement on the homepage already exists.

A hiring manager or company visiting the portfolio should encounter nothing unfinished or placeholder-feeling. They should be able to get all the information they need to decide whether to move forward.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Production-ready quality** - No rough edges, placeholder copy, or unfinished feeling anywhere
- **Hiring manager ready** - All information a company needs to evaluate me is present and polished
- **Consistency** - All pages should sound like the same person wrote them

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- New pages or sections — just polish what exists
- Resume link placement — already on homepage, no changes needed
- Case study content — already complete from Phase 9/13

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Resume PDF needs to be added to public folder and linked
- About, Contact, and homepage intro copy need review and polish
- Focus areas: About page voice/positioning, Contact page completeness

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This is an urgent insertion (Phase 14.1) because the portfolio needs to be interview-ready. The priority is ensuring a hiring manager sees a polished, complete site.
