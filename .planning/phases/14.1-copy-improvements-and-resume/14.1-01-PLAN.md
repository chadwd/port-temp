**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- Homepage hero already has real copy: "Chad Dunbar, Principal Product Designer, 15+ years leading enterprise UX"
- Resume button already exists, links to `/files/resume.pdf`
- Editorial, calm, confident tone established throughout site

**Voice guidance from case studies:**
- First-person, direct, no fluff
- Systems thinker who operates end-to-end
- Focuses on outcomes and operating models, not just deliverables
- Emphasizes enabling others, not just individual execution
- 15+ years enterprise UX, AI systems design, design engineering

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Draft and update About page copy</name>
  <files>src/pages/about.astro</files>
  <action>
Replace placeholder text in About page with production-ready copy:

**Background section:**
- 15+ years in product design, specializing in enterprise UX, AI systems, and design engineering
- Currently focused on AI-enabled workflows and design systems at scale
- Experience includes leading platform-level redesigns and cross-functional delivery
- Emphasize systems thinking and end-to-end ownership

**Design Philosophy section:**
- Core belief: design the operating model, not just the interface
- Focus on outcomes over outputs, enabling over directing
- Reduce friction between disciplines (design, engineering, product)
- Make complexity legible without oversimplifying

**Approach section:**
- First-principles problem framing before execution
- Parallel design and research when timelines are tight
- Early scoping artifacts to surface risk while changes are cheap
- Design full systems upfront, even when delivery is phased

Keep the editorial, calm, confident tone. No buzzwords. Direct and substantive.

The homepage already links to `/files/resume.pdf` but the file doesn't exist yet.

To add it:
1. Place your resume PDF at: `public/files/resume.pdf`
   - Create the `files` folder if it doesn't exist: `mkdir -p public/files`
   - Copy your PDF there

Or tell me the path to your existing resume PDF and I'll copy it.
