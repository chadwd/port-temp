# Phase 14.1 Plan 01: Copy Improvements and Resume Summary

**Production-ready About page copy, real contact info, ContactCTA component on all major pages, and working resume PDF download**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 12 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-01T16:41:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-01T16:53:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (+ 1 added: ContactCTA component)
- **Files modified:** 8

## Accomplishments

- Replaced placeholder About page with comprehensive professional copy (Background, Design Philosophy with Integrity/Courage/Unity principles, How I Operate Day to Day)
- Updated Contact page with real email (chad.dunbar@gmail.com), LinkedIn, and GitHub links (removed Twitter)
- Created ContactCTA component and added to Homepage, Work, Writing, and About pages
- Added resume PDF (108KB) that downloads from homepage button

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/pages/about.astro` - Complete rewrite with professional bio, philosophy, and approach sections
- `src/pages/contact.astro` - Real contact info replacing placeholders
- `src/components/ContactCTA.astro` - New reusable "Let's Connect" section
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Added ContactCTA component
- `src/pages/work/index.astro` - Added ContactCTA component
- `src/pages/writing/index.astro` - Added ContactCTA component
- `public/files/resume.pdf` - Updated with Chad-Dunbar-Resume-Jan-2026.pdf
- `public/files/Chad-Dunbar-Resume-Jan-2026.pdf` - Source resume file

## Decisions Made

- Created reusable ContactCTA component rather than duplicating code across pages
- Kept both resume files (original name for reference, resume.pdf for URL stability)
- Used centered layout with subtle border-top for CTA section to maintain editorial feel

## Deviations from Plan

### Added Scope (User Request)

**ContactCTA component** - User requested adding contact info CTA to bottom of all major pages during execution. Created component and integrated across 4 pages.

**Total deviations:** 1 (added scope per user request)
**Impact on plan:** Beneficial addition, improves conversion for hiring managers

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness
