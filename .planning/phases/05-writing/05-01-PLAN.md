<objective>
Build the Writing section mirroring the case studies pattern: list page, detail pages, and homepage integration.

Purpose: Complete the content system with a Writing section that feels native to the site.
Output: /writing list page, /writing/[slug] detail pages, featured writing on homepage, sample post.

@src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro

**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- Mirror case study patterns exactly (from CONTEXT.md)
- Same card components, layout patterns, visual language
- Featured content on homepage in grid layout

**Key pattern to follow:**
- Writing collection already defined in config.ts (simpler than case-studies - no confidentiality)
- CaseStudyCard can be adapted or a simpler WritingCard created
- Same grid layout (2 columns desktop, 1 mobile)

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create writing list page at /writing</name>
  <files>src/pages/writing/index.astro</files>
  <action>
    Create list page mirroring /work pattern:

    **Structure:**
    - Page title: "Writing"
    - Brief intro paragraph (essays and thoughts on design, AI, blockchain)
    - Grid of writing entries (sorted by date, newest first)

    **Implementation:**
    - Use getCollection('writing') from astro:content
    - Sort by date descending
    - Create WritingCard component OR reuse simpler card pattern
    - Grid: 2 columns desktop, 1 column mobile (same as /work)

    **Card content:**
    - Title (linked to detail page)
    - Description (one line)
    - Date (formatted)
    - Tags as small pills (optional, subtle)
    - NO confidentiality badges (writing doesn't have this field)

    **Handle empty state:**
    - If no posts, show placeholder message
  </action>
  <verify>
    - npm run dev shows /writing page
    - Page renders without errors
    - npm run build succeeds
  </verify>
  <done>Writing list page exists at /writing, displays posts or empty state</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create dynamic article detail pages</name>
  <files>src/pages/writing/[...slug].astro</files>
  <action>
    Create dynamic route mirroring /work/[slug] pattern:

    **Structure:**
    - Full-width hero with title
    - Date and tags below title
    - Main content area with .prose styling
    - Back link to /writing

    **Implementation:**
    - Use getCollection and getEntry for static paths
    - Render markdown content with Astro's Content component
    - Apply .prose class to content for typography
    - Simpler than case study page (no confidentiality badge)

    **Styling:**
    - Same hero pattern as case study detail
    - Same prose styling for content
    - Consistent with site feel
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Dynamic route pattern works
    - npm run build succeeds
    - Ready to render posts when content added
  </verify>
  <done>Detail page template ready at /writing/[slug]</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add sample post and integrate featured writing on homepage</name>
  <files>src/content/writing/sample-essay.md, src/pages/index.astro</files>
  <action>
    **Part A: Create sample writing post**

    Frontmatter:
    ```yaml
    ---
    title: "Designing for AI: Lessons from the Field"
    description: "Thoughts on creating interfaces that bridge human intuition and machine intelligence."
    date: 2024-07-20
    tags: ["AI", "Design", "Product"]
    ---
    ```

    Content:
    - Introduction section
    - 2-3 short sections with placeholder text
    - Markdown formatting: headers, paragraphs, maybe a quote or list

    **Part B: Add featured writing section to homepage**

    - Add new section below "Selected Work" titled "Recent Writing" or similar
    - Fetch writing posts (no featured flag - just show recent, limit 2-3)
    - Use same grid pattern as case studies
    - Add "View all writing" link to /writing

    **Layout:**
    - Same section pattern as Selected Work
    - Grid: 2 columns desktop, 1 mobile
    - "View all writing →" link centered below
  </action>
  <verify>
    - /writing shows the sample post
    - /writing/sample-essay loads and renders correctly
    - Homepage shows "Recent Writing" section with sample post
    - npm run build succeeds
  </verify>
  <done>Sample post visible, homepage shows recent writing section</done>
</task>

</tasks>
