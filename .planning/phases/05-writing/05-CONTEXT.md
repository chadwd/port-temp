# Phase 5: Writing - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-12-22
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The Writing section mirrors the case studies pattern exactly. A list page at /writing showing all posts, individual article pages for each piece. Same layout language, same card components, same visual feel as /work.

When someone visits Writing, it feels like the same site — consistent, calm, editorial. Articles are just another form of content alongside case studies, not a separate "blog" bolted on.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Consistency with Work** - Same card components, layout patterns, and visual language as case studies
- **Easy to add posts** - Drop markdown files with minimal frontmatter, just write
- **Featured on homepage** - Recent/featured writing visible on home alongside case studies

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

- Comments or social features - static content only, no reader interaction
- RSS feed - skip syndication for now
- Complex categorization - simple list is fine

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Reuse WritingCard component (or share CaseStudyCard if structure is similar enough)
- Same grid layout as /work page
- Featured writing on homepage in its own section
- Content collection already defined in Phase 1 (writing collection exists)

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This phase should be quick since it closely mirrors the case study implementation. The content collection schema is already defined, the card pattern exists, and the layout language is established.
