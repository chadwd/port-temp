**Reference implementation:**
@src/content/case-studies/ds-bridge.md
@src/content/config.ts

**Prior phase context:**
@.planning/phases/09-real-content/09-01-SUMMARY.md

**User context from CONTEXT.md:**
- User will provide 2 complete case study markdown files with frontmatter and images
- This is content integration work, not content creation
- Follow DS-Bridge directory structure exactly
- Validate all images display correctly on both list view (cards) and detail pages
- Ensure frontmatter matches schema validation

**Established patterns from Phase 9:**
- Case studies in `src/content/case-studies/{slug}.md`
- Images in `public/images/case-studies/{slug}/` with naming: `hero.png`, `image-01.png`, `image-02.png`, etc.
- Frontmatter schema: title, description, date, featured, confidentiality, tags, coverImage
- Absolute image paths from /public: `/images/case-studies/{slug}/hero.png`
- Inline images referenced with markdown: `![Alt text](/images/case-studies/{slug}/image-NN.png)`

**Schema requirements (from config.ts):**
- title: string (required)
- description: string (required)
- date: date (required)
- featured: boolean (default: false)
- confidentiality: enum 'public' | 'partial' | 'nda' (default: 'public')
- tags: array of strings (default: [])
- coverImage: string (optional, absolute path from /public)

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <action>Provide 2 case study markdown files and associated images</action>
  <instructions>
    I'm ready to integrate 2 new case studies into your portfolio.

    Please provide:

    **For each case study:**
    1. Markdown file with complete frontmatter (title, description, date, tags, coverImage path, confidentiality level)
    2. Hero image (hero.png, recommended 1600×900, 16:9 aspect ratio)
    3. Any inline images (image-01.png, image-02.png, etc., max 1200px wide recommended)

    **Frontmatter format to follow (from DS-Bridge):**
    ```yaml
    ---
    title: "Case Study Title"
    description: "Brief description for cards and metadata"
    date: 2025-12-31
    featured: false
    confidentiality: public
    tags: ["Tag 1", "Tag 2", "Tag 3"]
    coverImage: /images/case-studies/{slug}/hero.png
    ---
    ```

    **Image references in markdown:**
    ```markdown
    ![Descriptive alt text](/images/case-studies/{slug}/image-01.png)
    ```

    **Slug naming:** Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., my-project-name)

    Share the files however you prefer (paste content, attach, or provide file paths if already in your filesystem).

    1. Create markdown file: `src/content/case-studies/{slug}.md`

       - title, description, date are required
       - date format: YYYY-MM-DD
       - confidentiality must be 'public', 'partial', or 'nda'
       - tags must be array of strings (use Title Case per Phase 9 convention)
       - coverImage must be absolute path: /images/case-studies/{slug}/hero.png
    4. Verify all inline image references use absolute paths: /images/case-studies/{slug}/image-NN.png
    5. Ensure markdown follows DS-Bridge structure (sections, formatting)

    3. Confirm: 4 case studies total displayed (ds-bridge, new-car-pricing, + 2 new)
    4. Click each new case study card
    5. Detail pages: Verify hero image displays at top
    6. Detail pages: Verify inline images display correctly positioned in content
    7. Detail pages: Verify no broken image links
    8. Check: Responsive behavior on mobile/tablet (hero images scale properly)
    9. Check: Tags display correctly on cards
    10. Check: Confidentiality badges (if not 'public') display correctly
