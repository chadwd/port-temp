**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- Design tokens from Phase 2 (typography, colors, spacing)
- Minimal aesthetic - no flashy cards, content-first
- Case study infrastructure from Plan 1

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create CaseStudyCard component</name>
  <files>src/components/CaseStudyCard.astro</files>
  <action>
    Create reusable card component for case study previews:

    **Props:**
    - title: string
    - description: string
    - slug: string (for link)
    - date: Date
    - confidentiality: 'public' | 'partial' | 'nda'
    - tags?: string[]
    - image?: string (optional, for future use)

    **Structure:**
    - Clickable card linking to /work/{slug}
    - Title as h3
    - Description (truncated if needed)
    - Confidentiality badge (reuse pattern from detail page)
    - Tags as small pills (optional, subtle)

    **Styling:**
    - Minimal, editorial feel
    - Subtle hover state (not flashy)
    - Use design tokens for spacing
    - Border or subtle background to define card area
    - Responsive (stack on mobile, grid on desktop)

    **Keep it simple:**
    - No images in v1 (can add later)
    - No complex animations
    - Focus on typography and whitespace
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Component imports without errors
    - TypeScript types are correct
    - npm run build succeeds
  </verify>
  <done>CaseStudyCard component ready for use in list and homepage</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update homepage with featured case studies</name>
  <files>src/pages/index.astro</files>
  <action>
    Replace placeholder in "Selected Work" section with actual case studies:

    **Implementation:**
    - Import getCollection from astro:content
    - Import CaseStudyCard component
    - Filter for featured: true case studies
    - Sort by date descending
    - Limit to 3-4 featured items

    **Layout:**
    - Grid of cards (2 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile)
    - "View all work" link to /work page below grid

    **Empty state:**
    - If no featured case studies, show subtle message
    - (This shouldn't happen with sample content from Plan 1)

    **Styling:**
    - Use .container for width
    - Generous spacing between cards
    - "View all work" link styled as text link, not button
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Homepage shows featured case study card(s)
    - "View all work" link goes to /work
    - Responsive layout works on mobile
    - npm run build succeeds
  </verify>
  <done>Homepage displays featured case studies from content collection</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update work list page to use card component</name>
  <files>src/pages/work/index.astro</files>
  <action>
    Refactor /work page to use CaseStudyCard component:

    **Changes:**
    - Import CaseStudyCard component
    - Replace inline list items with card components
    - Add grid layout for cards

    **Layout:**
    - Grid: 2 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile
    - Consistent with homepage card grid
    - Generous gap between cards

    **Keep:**
    - Page title and intro
    - Empty state handling
    - Sort order (date descending)
  </action>
  <verify>
    - /work page uses card components
    - Cards link to correct detail pages
    - Grid layout is responsive
    - npm run build succeeds
  </verify>
  <done>Work page uses CaseStudyCard, consistent with homepage</done>
</task>
