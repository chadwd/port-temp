# Phase 11 Plan 2: CLAUDE.md Summary

**Comprehensive AI collaboration guide created for accelerated future development**

## Accomplishments

- Created CLAUDE.md with 12 comprehensive sections for AI assistant collaboration
- Documented project overview, tech stack, and complete project structure
- Explained content management workflow and critical image path requirements
- Added code conventions, common tasks, and testing procedures
- Included performance requirements and deployment information
- Provided AI-specific guidelines for troubleshooting and best practices

## Files Created/Modified

- `CLAUDE.md` - Complete AI collaboration documentation (12 sections, 558 lines)
  - Project Overview (what, stack, principles)
  - Tech Stack (framework, language, styling, content, deployment, images)
  - Project Structure (directory tree with explanations)
  - Key Files (config.ts, global.css, astro.config.mjs, deploy.yml)
  - Content Management (case studies, writing, schema, image workflow)
  - Design System (colors, typography, layout)
  - Code Conventions (components, styling, content collections)
  - Common Tasks (add case study, modify tokens, add page, update nav)
  - Testing & Verification (build, dev, type checking)
  - Performance & Accessibility (Lighthouse 100/100, WCAG AA, features)
  - Deployment (automatic GitHub Pages, manual build)
  - For AI Assistants (critical workflows, best practices, troubleshooting, philosophy)

## Decisions Made

**Image path documentation:**
- Emphasized CRITICAL nature of absolute paths (`/images/...`) vs relative paths
- Highlighted common pitfall: Astro content collections don't support relative paths in markdown
- Provided clear troubleshooting steps for "Could not find image" errors

**Documentation focus:**
- Prioritized practical workflows over theoretical concepts
- Included copy-paste code examples for common tasks
- Emphasized project philosophy: simplicity, accessibility, performance

**Structure:**
- Progressive disclosure from high-level (overview) to detailed (AI guidelines)
- Grouped related information (content management with image workflow)
- Made critical information stand out with bold headings

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Steps

Phase 11 (Documentation) complete. All deliverables shipped:
- Plan 1: README.md for human developers
- Plan 2: CLAUDE.md for AI assistants

Ready to proceed to Phase 12 or close out milestone.
