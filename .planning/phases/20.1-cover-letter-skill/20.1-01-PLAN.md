**Prior decisions affecting this phase:**
- Weighted scoring algorithm (tag match 40%, domain 25%, recency 20%, impact 15%) from job-matcher
- XYZ formula enforcement for accomplishments
- Human-in-the-loop review process with rationale
- Markdown output format for editability
- Job-analysis file integration for context-aware generation

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <action>Provide cover letter documentation and context</action>
  <instructions>
    Before building the cover letter generator skill, I need documentation about your preferred cover letter structure and direction.

    Please provide:
    1. Cover letter structure guidelines (opening, body paragraphs, closing)
    2. Best practices for professional cover letters (2026 standards)
    3. Tone and voice preferences
    4. Length guidelines (word count, paragraph count)
    5. How to connect accomplishments to job requirements
    6. Any specific formatting requirements

    I'll capture this in `.planning/phases/20.1-cover-letter-skill/20.1-CONTEXT.md` and reference it during skill creation (similar to how Phase 18 used context documents).

    You can provide this as:
    - Raw documentation to paste
    - Links to reference materials
    - Your own guidelines and preferences
    - Examples of strong cover letters you like
  </instructions>

  <name>Task 2: Create cover letter generator skill</name>
  <files>.claude/skills/cover-letter-generator/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
    Create cover letter generator skill following established skill patterns from Phase 18:

    **Structure:**
    - YAML frontmatter (name, description, location: user)
    - Purpose section (what this skill does, output format)
    - Context section (@references to profile.yaml, 20.1-CONTEXT.md, job-matcher patterns)
    - Process section (step-by-step workflow)
    - Human-in-the-loop section (review and approval workflow)

    **Process workflow:**
    1. Validate inputs (job posting link, job-analysis file path)
    2. Load job-analysis file (extract role context, pain points, cultural signals)
    3. Score profile content for relevance (use proven weighted algorithm from job-matcher)
    4. Generate cover letter using template from 20.1-CONTEXT.md
    5. Present draft with rationale and content selection explanation
    6. User reviews and approves/adjusts
    7. Output final markdown file to src/data/cover-letters/[company]-[role]-cover-letter.md

    **Template structure (from 20.1-CONTEXT.md):**
    - Follow paragraph structure defined in context document
    - Use XYZ formula for accomplishment integration
    - Maintain professional tone and voice from context guidelines
    - Connect profile accomplishments to job requirements naturally

    **Key patterns to reuse:**
    - Input validation (Scenarios A-D from resume-generator)
    - Weighted scoring (40% tag match, 25% domain, 20% recency, 15% impact)
    - Job-analysis integration (leverage pre-scored content)
    - Human review checkpoint with rationale
    - Markdown output with naming convention

    **Avoid:**
    - Generic template language (use context guidelines for specificity)
    - Auto-submission (user maintains control)
    - Overly formal or outdated cover letter conventions
  </action>
  <verify>
    - .claude/skills/cover-letter-generator/SKILL.md exists
    - File has YAML frontmatter with correct metadata
    - Process section includes all 7 steps
    - References 20.1-CONTEXT.md for template structure
    - Follows same patterns as resume-generator and cv-generator
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Skill file created with complete process workflow
    - Template structure based on 20.1-CONTEXT.md guidelines
    - Input validation handles all scenarios
    - Weighted scoring algorithm implemented
    - Human review checkpoint included
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Test cover letter generator with existing job-analysis files</name>
  <files>None (testing only)</files>
  <action>
    Test the cover letter generator skill by running through the process with existing job-analysis files:

    1. Read existing job-analysis files:
       - src/data/job-analysis/coinbase-senior-staff-product-designer-platform.md
       - src/data/job-analysis/aws-principal-ux-designer-applied-ai.md
       - src/data/job-analysis/trm-labs-senior-product-designer.md

    2. For each job-analysis file:
       - Verify skill can parse job context correctly
       - Confirm weighted scoring identifies relevant accomplishments
       - Check template structure follows 20.1-CONTEXT.md guidelines
       - Validate output file naming convention

    3. Generate sample cover letter for ONE job (Coinbase or AWS) to verify:
       - Opening paragraph connects to company/role
       - Body paragraphs integrate relevant accomplishments naturally
       - Closing maintains professional tone from context guidelines
       - Length meets word/paragraph count from context

    4. Document test results:
       - Which accomplishments scored highest
       - How template structure was applied
       - Any gaps or improvements needed
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Test run completes without errors
    - Sample cover letter generated for one role
    - Output follows 20.1-CONTEXT.md template structure
    - File saved to src/data/cover-letters/ with correct naming
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Skill tested with real job-analysis files
    - Sample cover letter demonstrates proper structure
    - Template application verified against context guidelines
    - Ready for production use in Phase 20
  </done>
</task>
