- `src/data/cover-letters/` - Output directory for generated cover letters

**Modified:**
- None

## Decisions Made

**Template Structure:**
- Adopted 6-paragraph marketing-document approach (not autobiography)
- Paragraph 1: Identity and Intent (1-2 sentences, company-specific)
- Paragraph 2: Summary and Transition (impact statement + setup)
- Paragraphs 3-4: Skill Match (top 2 skills from matching table, story themes)
- Paragraph 5: Why This Company (values-driven + product-driven reasons)
- Paragraph 6: Conclusion (confident, direct, invite next steps)

**Scoring and Selection:**
- Reused proven weighted algorithm from job-matcher (Phase 15.03)
- Top 2 accomplishments only (focus over breadth)
- Skill-matching table internal reasoning (Column 1: JD phrase, Column 2: Candidate match)
- Story themes: Leading people, Taking initiative, Solving problems, Working across disciplines, Curiosity, Managing conflict, Recovering from failure

**Integration:**
- Job-analysis file provides pre-scored accomplishments and company research
- Output location: `src/data/cover-letters/[company]-[role]-cover-letter.md`
- Human-in-the-loop approval required before saving (no auto-generation)
- Markdown format for editability

**Style Guidelines:**
- One page maximum (~300-400 words)
- Clear and concise, professional but human
- Specific over clever, short sentences
- Employer language over candidate language
- 90-second read target

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - test generation validated all workflow steps successfully.

## Next Phase Readiness
