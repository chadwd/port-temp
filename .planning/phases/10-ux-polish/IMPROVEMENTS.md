# Phase 10: UX Polish - Improvements

## Image Interaction Enhancements

### Full Screen Image Viewer
- Allow users to click on images (inline images in prose content) to view full screen
- Provide close/dismiss option to exit full screen view
- Consider:
  - Modal overlay with darkened background
  - ESC key to close
  - Click outside image to close
  - Navigation between images (prev/next) if multiple images in content
  - Smooth transitions/animations
  - Accessibility (focus trap, screen reader announcements)
